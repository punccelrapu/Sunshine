lich is my best hero

nova, dr, nova, dr, nova, chain, nova, dr, dr, get armor for mellee heroes but one point for the slow, get stats then.

get ring of regen and brances first, last hit EVERYTHING you can and deny full health creeps with your dr to lessen exp for your enemy

then go boots (norm), mek, bracers if you need health. i go bloodstone and A zepter for max survive and nuke power with your ult. lothars is also very handy so you can chain frost without getting stunned and nuked before you cast. once you're unkillable go around own some bitches, get that paper (gold) and buy support items to interrupt as much as possible. lich is good nuke early game but is amazing support end game. you can't really kill 1 hero end game, but you can fuck over 2-3.

eye of skadi is effective while chain frost is running dude, u can shot ur enemy while he's freeze with the frost effect and then finish him with frost nova if he strong enough to survive, and it also boost lich hp
 
Lol u only need like
1.Bracers
2.BoT
3.BkB (if they gank alot and u need sumthing to disable their stun)
4.Mekasm or Hex whichever ur team need ( i recommend finish Head of Rej first then juz go for BoT afta tat, ur team can handle until later)
5.GUESS Wad??? REFRESHER LOL!!!!! imagine 2 bounces at once lol (might need observer ward)

This guide help me win every game wif lich lol
 
Lich works well as a Ganker Slow with his Nova. Get BoT for lane control, Agms, Shivas or Curiass, Blood, Orchid. dagon is optional if enemy is full of str type heros else chain is enough for agi/int type hero. Blink is bad for him. Lothars if you need an escape mechanism for which i think a Phase is unnecessary.
 
im a lich adict and what i do is always go for dagon first then make any item build according the type of enemy heroes,i usually get kills not less than 20 and 1 or two deaths at the end of the game.dagon and shiva are the two items that i do not substitute, i always have those two. happy gaming guys :D
 
Hey, I'm a freeze mage enthusiast and a guy who generally likes to play control. You can find me here. I wanted to share the deck I've created inspired by the deck I've used to play in the past. At the same time I'm looking for possible advice/suggestions. So far it was working out really good in the current metagame full of paladins and token druids and between rank 5-3 it netted me a 16-4 score (the sample size isn't the biggest thus it's a bit of a clickbait, but it definitely has a high winrate in these conditions).
 
So what is this deck? It's a turbocharged freeze mage with much more earlygame allowing you to contest the board and deal face damage in the meantime while drawing with Coldlight Oracle. It can also win the lategame by putting down a lot of minions and dealing damage through frost nova.

The initial version had 2x Arcane Missiles instead of 2x Glacial Shard. I have been offered to test crabs instead of shards, but so far they have been working out great and maybe I'll do that later when I have the dust for crabs. I also don't like the Firelands Portal too much, but I couldn't think of anything better.
 
Secretkeeper might find a slot instead of glacial shard, but since we run only 2x ice blocks ourselves it's not very reliable. I believe if you're facing a lot of secret decks this might be worth a try. I would be running leper gnomes if they were still 2/1, but their 1/1 body is too small to do impact. In my opinion without many secrets the same applies to secretkeeper.
 
Frost claw:
The skill would feel a lot better if there is no arc delay due to verticality. It feels unresponsive when the projectile feels fast in the middle and slow at the start and the end. The whole experience made worse by the middle projectile miss the enemy due to its vertical arc.
A node that gives the skill explode on impact rather than the end would improve the clunkiness.
 
Flame rush:
Please remove the delay of explosion when using the node that auto-summon the glyph of dominion. It make the skill build clunky.
Needing to double dip on lightning conversion to reach frost conversion feels bad.
The node to double mana and cd efficiency by overcapping fire res to 150% is underwhelming for how much effort it need. It just reduces mp cost by around 3 and cd around 0.1-0.2s.
 
Frost wall:
I did not use this much but it feels clunky in a PVE ARPG to have a narrow line skill that only affects enemy that pass through, with high mp consumption. I can see the use in the arena but it is too circumstantial for my taste
Would be much better if by default, it is made into a true zoning skill, low-med MP and damage with freeze/ slow capability, so it can be used more freely. An alternative to snap freeze so to say, then the nodes can add the +dmg+mp option.
 
Glyph:
I think it suffers a similar identity issue with frost wall. Is it a damage skill or utility skill? I can see it being the main damage skill with increased expansion speed nodes but i have not try it out as I am still testing the runic invocation playstyle. Tbh, with so much offensive skill that runemaster have, I would prefer the glyph to have more utility nodes than the current one.
 
Runic invocation
Suffers same issue as old invoker in Dota. Too many skill combos and some combinations are just simply better by miles, rendering a lot of the other skills useless. My opinion is removing unique sequence order like current dota invoker would make the class easier to balance and optimized.
A new node to add duration would be nice.
The jump skill is fun but somewhat clunky as the jump is a lot slower than the movement speed.
Is there a way/node to improve the cast animation? Cast speed does not seem to do the trick
 
Passives:
I feel that the latter part of the passives tree to be a bit underwhelming. No or few nodes that alter playstyle. The one that add duration to runeword is shockingly disappointing when I read it. Also, more than a point in the runeword %chance is a waste with how spammy the whole class is and because the runeword does not stack.
The passive nodes that requires active rune to have effects feels inconsistent to use when runic invocation constantly use up the rune (same issue with the node in the invocation skill)
 
Adding to frost wall identity issue. Its default is an enemy cc type that blocks enemy. But its utility nodes requires character to pass the wall. On a mage class that is fragile close range, it is contradictory to approach the wall/enemies.
 
For the glyph, the node to cast elemental nova on the delayed explosion is underwhelming as it only cast once. Should be auto-cast elemental nova during the delay period. Additional point for +1 fire aura seems yo be not worth it.
 
This guide is no longer being updated because I can't abide playing this game any more. The lag is terrible, there are no new DGs, stat tracking is broken, the list goes on. I waited MONTHS for Stardock and GPG to get their sh\*t together and it still hasn't happened. I can't believe I paid $40 for this game; it should never have gotten out of beta. I have gone back to playing DotA.

 



1. INTRODUCTION
 The Torch Bearer is one of the most innately powerful DGs. He does not require many items to dominate; however, he is the best farmer in the game hands down, which makes it very easy for him to acquire items. This build focuses on maximizing his burst damage and AoE farming abilities by using both sides of the skill tree. You will drop your opponents very quickly, leaving them surprised (and dead). You will never have to go to base to heal. You will kill towers and creeps with ease. And then you will buy many items, and many upgrades.

3. STRATEGY / MACRO
Early Game (before buying Heart of Life): 
 Switch between lanes, killing each creep wave instantly with one AoE spell. Try to go to lanes with enemy-controlled flags and cap them. If you encounter a strong enemy, hit them with your AoE spell while killing their creeps at the same time. Then fireball them and go to another lane. Harass your opponents constantly so they cannot farm effectively. Destroy their creeps so they must retreat to their tower (where they cannot kill creeps because their own tower destroys them). Get kills when you can; see kill strategy below.

Mid Game (after buying Heart of Life):
 Continue to bounce between lanes, but now actively engage and harass enemies at every lane. Drive them back from the flag using all your spells from range, then cap the flag. If they try to rush you, run behind your creeps/tower and use Heart of Life. Now you are at full life and mana; rinse and repeat. Dominate and farm every lane. Kill anyone who tries to resist you 1v1. Focus on map control and getting $$$ - your enemies will come to you. Never go to base if you can.

Late Game:
 Continue making gold like it's your job. Get yourself a Godplate if your opponents are tough enough. Then dump money into creep upgrades. Destroy enemy towers - your spells work on them! Push the enemy base by repeatedly nuking towers and keeping yourself full with the Hea
