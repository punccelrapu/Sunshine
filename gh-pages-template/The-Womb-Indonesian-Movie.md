In my case, however, I oppose the idea that life is a point between womb and tomb! I believe that life is a beautiful gift for the soul in order to evolve in its spiritual journey. It is a beautiful way for soul to grow into a blooming higher power. I would like to mention a few assumptions (you can call it a product of my little reading, experience, and even beliefs) before I proceed.

Even though in one life it may appear a journey between womb and tomb, from one point (birth) to the other (death), it is certainly not so. Believing in such a view would mean an outright rejection of the possibilities of continuation of the existence of soul (call it even mind or energy) beyond death.
 
Believing that our life is pointless and handling it recklessly is a sign of immaturity. Look within yourself. All answers lie within. All knowledge is within you. Once you connect with your inner self, you will be astonished to see your own vastness and limits. Never shy away from experiencing emotions. This is the privilege bestowed upon us.
 
**Bangkalan**. A distressing incident unfolded in Panpajung Village, Modung District, Bangkalan Regency, East Java. On March 4, Mukarromah, 25, experienced a horrifying delivery where the infant's head was severed and left inside her womb.
 
Mukarromah initially sought a referral for a cesarean section at Bangkalan Hospital from the village midwife. However, the midwife advised her to undergo the delivery at the Kedungdung Community Health Center instead.
 
"I wanted a referral letter, but the midwife told me to go to the health center. I wanted a cesarean section because my baby was in a breech position. When I pushed, the baby's body was pulled, and its head got severed," shared Mukarromah on Tuesday.
 
Responding to the viral nature of the case, the Bangkalan Health Department asserted that the actions of the Kedungdung Health Center midwife were in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP).

"Here's the situation. The baby inside the womb was already deceased, undergoing a process of decomposition. So, when it was removed, a part of the head was left in the womb," clarified Nur Hotibah, the Head of the Bangkalan Health Department on Tuesday.
 
The **uterus** (from Latin *uterus*, pl.: **uteri**) or **womb** (/wuːm/) is the organ in the reproductive system of most female mammals, including humans, that accommodates the embryonic and fetal development of one or more embryos until birth.[1] The uterus is a hormone-responsive sex organ that contains glands in its lining that secrete uterine milk for embryonic nourishment.
 
In the human embryo, the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts, which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus. The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.
 
In medicine and related professions, the term *uterus* is consistently used, while the Germanic-derived term *womb* is commonly used in everyday contexts. Events occurring within the uterus are described with the term **in utero**.
 
The endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus. It has a basal layer and a functional layer; the functional layer thickens and then is shed during the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the uterine glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number and form the decidua. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.[8][9]
 
The uterus is primarily supported by the pelvic diaphragm, perineal body, and urogenital diaphragm. Secondarily, it is supported by ligaments, including the peritoneal ligament and the broad ligament of uterus.[16]
 
Normally, the human uterus lies in anteversion and anteflexion. In most women, the long axis of the uterus is bent forward on the long axis of the vagina, against the urinary bladder. This position is referred to as anteversion of the uterus. Furthermore, the long axis of the body of the uterus is bent forward at the level of the internal os with the long axis of the cervix. This position is termed anteflexion of the uterus.[17] The uterus assumes an anteverted position in 50% of women, a retroverted position in 25% of women, and a midposed position in the remaining 25% of women.[2]
 
The uterus is located in the middle of the pelvic cavity, in the frontal plane (due to the broad ligament of the uterus). The fundus does not extend above the *linea terminalis*, while the vaginal part of the cervix does not extend below the interspinal line. The uterus is mobile and moves posteriorly under the pressure of a full bladder, or anteriorly under the pressure of a full rectum. If both are full, it moves upwards. Increased intra-abdominal pressure pushes it downwards. The mobility is conferred to it by a musculo-fibrous apparatus that consists of suspensory and sustentacular parts. Under normal circumstances, the suspensory part keeps the uterus in anteflexion and anteversion (in 90% of women) and keeps it "floating" in the pelvis. The meanings of these terms are described below:
 
In cases where the uterus is "tipped", also known as retroverted uterus, the woman may have symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse, pelvic pain during menstruation, minor incontinence, urinary tract infections, fertility difficulties,[18] and difficulty using tampons. A pelvic examination by a doctor can determine if a uterus is tipped.[19]
 
Bilateral Mllerian ducts form during early human fetal life. In males, anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) secreted from the testes leads to the ducts' regression. In females, these ducts give rise to the fallopian tubes and the uterus. In humans, the lower segments of the two ducts fuse to form a single uterus; in cases of uterine malformations this fusion may be disturbed. The different uterine morphologies among the mammals are due to varying degrees of fusion of the Mllerian ducts.
 
The primary reproductive function of the human uterus is to prepare for the implantation of a zygote, a fertilized ovum, and maintenance of pregnancy if implantation occurs.[21] Traveling along the fallopian tube on its way to the uterine cavity, the zygote divides mitotically to become a blastocyst, which ultimately attaches to the uterine wall and implants into the endometrium.[4] The placenta later develops to nourish the embryo, which grows through embryonic and fetal development until childbirth. During this process, the uterus grows to accommodate the growing fetus.[22] When normal labor begins, the uterus forcefully contracts as the cervix dilates, which results in delivery of the infant.[22]
 
In the absence of pregnancy, menstruation occurs.[21] The withdrawal of female sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone, which occurs in the absence of fertilization, triggers the shedding of the functional layer of the endometrium.[21] This layer is broken down, shed, and restored in anticipation of the next menstrual cycle.[21] The average bleeding duration during menses is 5-7 days after which the menstrual cycle begins again.

A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, which may be carried out for a number of reasons including the ridding of tumours both benign and malignant. A complete hysterectomy involves the removal of the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus. A partial hysterectomy may just involve the removal of the uterine body while leaving the cervix intact. It is the most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure.
 
The procedure remains the last resort: it is as of 2023, a relatively new and somewhat experimental procedure, performed only by certain specialist surgeons in select centres, it is expensive and unlikely to be covered by insurance, and it involves risk of infection and organ rejection. Some ethics specialists consider the risks to a live donor too great, and some find the entire procedure ethically questionable, especially since the transplant is not a life-saving procedure.[28][29][30]
 
Most animals that lay eggs, such as birds and reptiles, including most ovoviviparous species, have an oviduct instead of a uterus. However, recent research into the biology of the viviparous (not merely ovoviviparous) skink *Trachylepis ivensi* has revealed development of a very close analogue to eutherian mammalian placental development.[31]
 
In monotremes, mammals which lay eggs, namely the platypus and the echidnas, either the term *uterus* or *oviduct* is used to describe the same organ, but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization.
 
Marsupials have two uteri, each of which connect to a lateral vagina and both use a third, middle "vagina", which functions as the birth canal.[32][33] Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline placenta (which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a "true" placenta), in which the egg's yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryo's nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mother's bloodstream. However, bandicoots also have a rudimentary chorioallantoic placenta, similar to those of placental mammals.
 
The fetus usually develops fully in placental mammals and only partially in marsupials including kangaroos and opossums. In marsupials, the uterus forms as a duplex organ of two uteri. In monotremes such as the platypus, the uterus is duplex and r
