The text I chose, a poem written by Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, is an oldfavorite of mine which I have used in many ways prior to my experience in theColloquium. It has been a resource for me in the teaching of prayer, discussionsof God and inquiries into human relations.
 
There must have been a time when you entered a room and met someone and after a while you understood that unknown to either of you there was a reason you had met. You had changed the other and he had changed you. By some word or deed or just by your presence the errand had been completed. Then perhaps you were a little bewildered or humbled and grateful. And it was over.
 
In thinking back on how I have used this poem over the years, I realize thatI generally saw "my puzzle" as a Jewish one. The pieces that I havecollected have, for the most part, been from others who have helped shape my Jewishidentity in a very direct way. The puzzle pieces that stand out most in mymemory relate to my acquiring a growing understanding of Judaism from withinthat tradition. These include learning Talmud, exploring the prayerbooks of ourpeople, uncovering the world of Midrash, growing in my observance of holidays,rituals and other Mitzvot. Each of these gifts of knowledge and feeling waspresented by a special teacher, an admired role model, a cherished colleague ora wonderful friend. Each of these gifts made me comfortable in the world ofJewish texts and practice. I certainly would not be the committed, identifying,knowledgeable Jew I am without the help of so many important people along theway. They gave so much of themselves, and "whether they know it ornot" they were messengers from the most High.
 
While I continue to grow as a Jew every day, several years ago I realizedthat I was at a point in my life where my Jewish "self" was firmly inplace and I truly felt that I "know who I am." Just about the time Iconsciously realized this, I applied to participate in The Catholic-JewishColloquium. I must admit that I really didn't know what to expect. Little did Iknow that as a result of my participation in the Colloquium, the jigsaw puzzleof my lifetime would not only change in size, but also in shape, as pieces wereadded.

It all started with the first session. We were strangers getting to know eachother and were being very careful about what we were saying. We had beenassigned to bring a text that was central in determining the way a Catholic orJew develops an understanding of tradition. I sat there resonating to most ofthe Jews who shared a variety of texts, many of which I "owned" aswell. The Catholic participants also shared their texts, some of which I hadstudied. The way many of them talked about their chosen text, however, was quiteforeign to me and made me uncomfortable. Their easy use of "faithlanguage," certain concepts of spirituality and personal relationship withJesus left me feeling ill-at-ease.
 
As a result of my discomfort, as well as having always wanted to ask thisquestion, I blurted out "Why do you need Jesus anyway? Why can't you relatedirectly to God?" As I recall, there was a shocked silence in the room andfinally a Catholic participant answered, "You just don't understand. Itisn't that we need Jesus. He just is!"
 
This simple, straightforward answer was not the "arms-length"intellectual response I had been looking for and shook me to the core of mybeing. At that moment, I realized, for the first time, that Christianity is notsome cognitive construct that people "choose" to acceptthey believeits truths as deeply as I believe the truths of Judaism. For me, Adonai"just is"; for them Jesus/God "just is." Simple? Yes! But, Ihad never conceived of this in these terms before.
 
During the next five sessions of the Colloquium, no matter what we weredoing, the critical element for me was spending time with deeply religiouspeople. We were Christians and Jews, sharing the love we feel for ourtraditions, the insights we have learned, and the truths we know and feel. Ispecifically remember one late night discussion with my Catholic roommate. Wehad spent time that day sharing the textual bases of our two faiths. He wasespecially impressed with the depth of knowledge the Jewish participants hadabout our texts. He had many questions, and as I answered them, I became moreand more passionate about the written words of our people. As I talked, I feltwonderful about my knowledge and my intense feelings about my texts.
 
At that time, however, I was also becoming quite conscious of my"jealousy" of the Catholic participants' ability to speak so easilyabout their spiritual experiences. I was, therefore, quite surprised when myroommate expressed his own jealousy over the depth of learning the Jewishparticipants had about their texts and the intellectual side of religion. When Ireacted to this and shared my own sense of what I was lacking, we both feltvalidated in who we are. We also learned something important about the strengthof the other and understood that we could help each other learn to "fill inthe gaps" we each sensed we were missing.
 
The simultaneous study of our two traditions gave us the opportunity totransmit to each other many of the declarations of "just is" that areat the core of our being. As we interacted in the process of studyingtheologies, histories and texts, we truly got a window into each otherssouls. For example, in Colloquium IV we focused on the immigrant experience ofboth Jews and Catholics. I had known that Catholics had faced some difficultieswhen they came to the U.S. I was really stunned, however, as the Catholicparticipants shared personal and family memories. The parallels to the pain ofthe American Jewish immigrant experience were striking and I believe that a newkind of bond was created between me and my Catholic colleagues.
 
Similarly, anger, sadness and sorrow were clearly evident in the Catholicseach time we studied medieval persecutions of Jews, and especially theHolocaust. Experiencing this allowed me to let go of much of my historicalresentment and diminished the focus on my own victimization. This led to anunburdening of much of the anger which I had carried around for years. Until Icould release myself from being a victim, I had no room to appreciateChristianity. By the last session, this transformation had taken place.
 
My colleagues in the Colloquium have shared freely of themselves in givingpieces of their puzzles to me and I have reciprocated. This occurred in theformal study sessions with leaders and scholars, in discussions withparticipants and during less formal times such as dinner and late nightdiscussions. If the truth be told, I have had deeper, more meaningfulconversations about God, faith and religion with my colleagues in this programthan I have had with any other group of people in my lifetime.
 
So what have I gained as a result of this experience which I believe hastransformed me as a Jew and a human being? At a foundational level, I havegained a true appreciation of Christianity. Previously I "tolerated"it as another religion, but it had, I believed, little from which I could learn.As a result of the intense study in the presence of intensely religiousCatholics, I see their religion as a true and valid faith for those who acceptit. It adds beauty and meaning to their lives and I can share in their joy overthis reality.
 
At a deeper level, I have come to understand and appreciate the tremendousfaith held by the Christians in our group. I found that they were much moreready to discuss, explain and clarify matters of spirituality and faith than aremany of the Jews I know. It seemed that they were not at all self-consciousabout sharing their inner lives. As a result of seeing their comfort, their joyand their satisfaction with uncovering this "just is" openly withthemselves and others, I wanted to share more and more of myself with them.
 
This brings me to the place where I found the greatest meaning as a result ofthe Colloquium. Because of my involvement with others who could so easilyexpress their faith, I dug inside myself and found that I, too, could be intouch with similar feelings within my own tradition in very new ways. This wasnot so surprising, but as time passed and we participated in more experiencestogether I was able to articulate ideas, concepts, feelings and beliefs thatsimply had not come easily to my tongue in the past.
 
In short, I am not the same person I was in February 1993 when we began thisodyssey together. As a result of our study, our discussions and arguments, andthe intimate relationships that have developed, I find myself a much morespiritual person. When I teach, God is not only talked about more often, God isactually present for me. I now look for opportunities to share my Judaism withnon-Jews, as well as chances to learn from and with them. As I look at theKushner poem today I see a greatly expanded puzzle. It is no longer anexclusively Jewish puzzle. Perhaps I can best describe the change by saying itis now a puzzle with a much more expansive picture. And yet, as I consider thisstatement I also know that my picture is more Jewish than ever.
 
I have given away many pieces of my puzzle to my friends in the Colloquium,but I have gained many more pieces from them. I believe I have "changed theother" and that the other has changed me. The gifts we have given andreceived have not simply left me "a little bewildered or humbled andgrateful." I know that they and weusare, in fact, messengers from theMost High.
 
Not sure which one you have found.
