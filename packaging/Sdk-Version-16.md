To apply the Apache License to specific files in your work, attach the following boilerplatedeclaration, replacing the fields enclosed by brackets "[]" with your ownidentifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) Enclose the text in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We alsorecommend that you include a file or class name and description of purpose on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easieridentification within third-party archives.
 
In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quicklybecome a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are indanger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having torelease new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies arespecified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity(assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable).Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuityprevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.
 
As a solution to this problem, we propose a simple set of rules andrequirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existingwidespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software.For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This mayconsist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it isimportant that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your publicAPI, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your versionnumber. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes notaffecting the API increment the patch version, backward compatible APIadditions/changes increment the minor version, and backward incompatible APIchanges increment the major version.
 
Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This APIcould be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation.However it is done, it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive.
