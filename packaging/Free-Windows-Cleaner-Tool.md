**Squeegee rubber** is also essential when purchasing window cleaning supplies. Squeegee rubber comes in soft or hard variations. Hard rubber is generally better for warmer temperatures, while soft is more suited for mild to colder temperatures. Although, many people use their preferred brand year-round. Some brands also offer a medium blend rubber. Whatever you choose, remember to change out your squeegee rubber when you notice a decrease in performance or streaks. While there is no standard time for changing out your squeegee rubber, it is definitely good practice to change them often. Rubber will generally come in 12 packs or a full gross which is 144 pieces, but other buying options may be available as well.

We only offer reliable, quality brands so you can trust the tools you use for effective results. So, what is a complete scrubber? A complete scrubber is a T-Bar and scrubber sleeve combo that is pre-selected for compatible sizes.
 
When selecting a **complete scrubber**, there are a few things to consider, such as the comfort of the handle, scrubbing power, and water retention of the washer sleeve itself. You can use these by hand or attach your T-Bar to an extension pole. Washer sleeves provide a thorough cleaning by applying solutions and agitating dirt effectively. Some of these vary in how aggressive the sleeve is, but we carry all of the top brands. With durable construction and ergonomic designs, complete scrubbers make window cleaning a breeze.
 
An **extension pole** is another valuable tool that allows you to reach those higher windows without needing a ladder. You can attach squeegees, t-bars, and scrapers depending on the job at hand. Generally, extension poles come in Carbon Fiber or Aluminum. If you plan on using your extension pole daily, we highly recommend using a full Carbon Fiber option. While more expensive than aluminum, it will massively reduce shoulder fatigue. Carbon Fiber is also lighter then Aluminum making it much easier to work with. With telescoping and modular options, we suggest reading our **Extension Pole Guide** or touching base with one of our **product experts** to help you select the perfect match.
 
We also carry a wide selection of window-cleaning towels for professionals. Our most popular selling option is huck towels. These **Recycled Surgical Towels** are 100% cotton and completely lint-free. We pre-sort through these hucks before we ship them out to you so there are no holes, frays, or blemishes. Window cleaners tend to like these because they are bigger and thicker at a great price. You will find towels ideal for detailing and polishing but also options for cleaning frames and absorbing excess water. If using an extension pole, you can drape your towel to the tip of your extension pole to reach higher spots.
 
Keep your window cleaning tools easily accessible and organized on your belt with our selection of **holsters and BOABs**. Designed for convenience and efficiency, these holsters and BOABs (Bucket on a Belt) provide a practical solution for carrying the essentials while on the job. Whether you need a simple single-loop holster for your squeegee or scraper or a more advanced BOAB that can carry different types and configurations of squeegees, we have you covered! Our holsters and BOABS are built to withstand the rigors of daily use, offering durability and reliability. Gone are the days of climbing up and down the ladder to get different tools, these tools allow you to have a hassle-free experience while keeping your favorite window cleaning supplies within reach. We also offer **window cleaning buckets** for those that prefer using a standard bucket. Buckets come in 3.5-round options or a 6-gallon option which will be wide enough to dunk your entire washer sleeve in while cleaning.
 
Whether you're just starting out or looking to outfit your employees with the essentials, our carefully curated **starter kits** include all the necessary window cleaning supplies to get started. From squeegees and scrapers to brushes and cleaning solutions, our starter kits provide a comprehensive solution for achieving spotless windows.

The AcroCleaner is not an uninstaller and should NOT be used as such. Adobe provides the utility as a least resort to repair machines after a failed or partial uninstall. Always uninstall products via standard, supported methods.
 
While most installs, uninstalls, and updates operations happen without incident, there are cases where a user may not be able to complete such tasks due to some registry or file conflict on the machine. This is particularly problematic when permissions set on plist entries or files prevent the successful installation of new installs and/or updates. The cleaner tool fixes such issues by cleaning up corrupted installations, removing or fixing corrupted files, removing or changing permissions registry entries, etc.
 
In some scenarios, the cleaner tool for Windows might affect some preferences common between Acrobat and Reader. Therefore, when both Acrobat and Reader products are installed on machine, Adobe recommends the remaining installed product be repaired after running the cleaner Tool.
 
If the product is not found, then Acrobat/Reader is cleaned from the default installation location at ProgramFilesFolder\Adobe\Acrobat \*.\* folder. The user is also given an option to select and add any other additional installation.
 
Applications found installed are listed separately for both Acrobat and Reader. By default, all the listed applications will be selected for clean-up. Following buttons below the lists can be used to customize the list.
 
If you have both Acrobat and Reader installed, removing the product that is the default PDF viewer can result in the other product failing to become the new default PDF viewer. When this problem occurs, run Repair on the remaining product and reboot the machine to make the remaining product the default PDF handler.
 
For Acrobat Pro Extended 9.x, the tool leaves the Acrobat entry in Add Remove Programs. To manually remove this entry, run an uninstallation from the ARP entry or manually remove the following registry entries:
 
The Cleaner Tool removes the Reader 9.x or Acrobat 9.x installation even if the user chooses Cancel at the Files in Use dialog during uninstallation. The File in Use dialog appears when you try to uninstall a currently running product.
 
I'm still evaluating it, but from what I can see so far there is nothing new in it, it is just collecting already existing MS tools into one UI.
They could have just as easily put it all on one page in the settings menu rather than creating an app.
 
Of course MS are still going to only clean the same they do already, and leave behind the things that MS wants there for their own purposes.
So people will still want to use 3rd party cleaners that clear out what MS doesn't.
 
It even tries to force things MS on you.
For instance it includes a setting to force Edge to be the default Browser, if you set that then when you try make another browser your default it will just switch it back to Edge.
Edit- see the post below, it looks that with a bit of further digging in the options you can set that for Chrome or Firefox too.
 
Perhaps more interestingly for this forum it also suggests that I should disable **Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit beta** which I have running on this machine.
Not sure if it would say the same about Malwarbytes itself? (Obviously I'm not running that or MBAE wouldn't be running).
Edit - A friend who has also tried it shows that it suggests turning off her RTP, Sandbox, and VM. So I suspect that it will suggest turning off Malwarebytes/Malwarebytes Service too. I guess MS only want you using Defender.
 
Hitting that 'Poceed' button the app says it's cleaned those listed items.
Firefox is still running so it's cache hasn't been cleared, is it just cleaning Edge? (I'll see what it does when I close FFx later).
A quick analyze with CCleaner finds 18 Windows logfiles that the MS app didn't clean.
Update - After closing Firefox I ran the MS app again, it didn't clear the Firefox Caches, Session information, or Site preferences at all.
