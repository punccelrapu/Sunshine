The four relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report using the same methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sea Level Change Curve Calculator. These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National Climate Assessment.

**Note**: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early 1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.
 
Another important change from the 2017 scenarios is the exclusion of the extreme (2.5 meter) scenario. Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has been removed.
 
For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.
 
A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can correct for this offset.

The inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.
 
Blue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.
 
In this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times. For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.
 
Predictions represent the potential distribution of each wetland type (see legend) based on their elevation and how frequently they may be inundated under each scenario. As sea levels increase, some marshes may migrate into neighboring low-lying areas, while other sections of marsh will change type or be lost to open water.
 
**Note**: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early 1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.
 
The Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.
 
Click on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings, and advisories.
 
The purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.
 
I am trying to figure out why one of my web maps is unable to access the related table. When I open the webmap in the old map viewer, I see the "Show Related Records" at the bottom of the popup, however, when I open the same webmap in the new map viewer this does not exist.
 
Thanks Esri for fixing it in Map Viewer. It's exactly what I wanted. We've had a related comments table that worked in Field Maps but had no way to show it. Now we can and it opens the door to more.... only if this works with Instant Apps, WxB, etc. I assume it does as it lives in the pop-up. Will test this next.

Anyhow, here's what I was hoping for and you delivered:


 
If you scroll down to the section "What Map Viewer Should I Use", it indicates the related records functionality is not in the new map viewer. This was on an ESRI road map for early 2022 . . . I would anticipate that it will become available in a future update of ArcGIS Online.
 
The version of Map Viewer released to Enterprise @ 10.9.1 does not support related records in tables or FCs. No idea why it is not available at release, but it isn't. This is functionality that is used all the time and without metrics, I could probably say a majority of customers use relationships in their solutions. A large percent of ESRI solutions have related records or features, so I can't understand why it was not included. I have to add related Signs (table) to the Feature class Poles (managed by relationship class in feature layers). Is there any timeframe for getting this functionality added back again? I have to use the Classic version that is backwards and was looking forward to all of the effort involved in the new Map Viewer, but useless in my case.
 
I've heard absolutely nothing other than "VIEWING" of related records/features in the Pop-ups may be in the beta for Online. No idea what that might mean about editing these! More Kudos! This is really something that I believe was a huge dropped ball.... Heaven knows if they get it fixed if it will show up in a patch for Enterprise 10.9.1 as we will not be able to go to 11 for a very long time due to the 32 bit application migration impacted by all of our existing attribute rules in attribute assistant/geometric network to Utility network on 4 utilities, etc........It would be nice for a change to get an update that does not remove functionality or fix very long-standing bugs (years or decades). Oops should not be an excuse and also I hope ESRI does not forget Enterprise 10.9.1!
 
Hi, was this ever added to the enterprise 10.9.1? I installed all patches and still don't have that option. It is not clear to me if 11.1 has it. It looks great in AGOL new map viewer im hoping for something in that sense in enterprise. thanks!
 
Since 2001, the USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) has been available to users for accessing remote sensing data. In 2017, it was redesigned to address changing internet technologies. With easy-to- use navigation tools, users can instantly view and download scenes.
 
This viewer allows you to:
