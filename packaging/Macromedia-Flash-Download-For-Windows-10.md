Well guys, i entered the strange world of the good well old OS Windows for Workgroups 3.11. I got the Internet Explorer 5 ready, as well as an local http server and even a tcp/ip stack that only runs on a non-existent network card (i just wanted to play local games). so my next idea was to install adobe flash player (oh excuse me, macromedia flash player) 3. i tried to start the swf-file in an htm file on the internet explorer 5.0 but the game seems to require adobe flash 9. 
is there any way to provide the ocx-file for adobe flash 9 to win 3.11, is there anyone with knowledge about the compatibilities out there? i also tried opera 3 and netscape navigator 4.07, but netscape even crashes at boot.
 
well it is just the good idea of running a swf file in an so old system. i know, there are plenty other easy ways. but i want to create this way specifically. the gnash idea doesnt sound too far. but.. i dont know, i would need to spend a bit of time for learning how to compile this application for being compatible with win32s. actually, it isn't since it says "invalid format" (guess there are libraries and functions which win32s doesn't provide). well lets see how this works out - or maybe even not.

\*Windows 3.1 - on an universal USB Stick without network stack (even with MS-DOS LAN Manager 3.x) - no way, you wont even get 127.0.0.1 to run - local file opening with IE5 or Netscape Navigator is possible, but nobody in their right mind would - flash support till Version 3 - not working practically, gnash wont work
\*Windows for Workgroups 3.11 - Macromedia (not Adobe ?) Flash Player till version 3 - not really much of an flash support - gnash just doesnt want to do anything and is still invalid format
\*Windows NT 3.1 - Macromedia doesnt work at all, gnash won't work crashes on some kernel-DLLs and mutters bout not having openGL
\*Windows NT 3.51 - this is more what we're talking about. Gnash still stresses around, but Firefox 2.0.22 a special adapted Edition for W95 and NT3.51 \*works\*! i found an flash NSPSWF32.DLL which does the Job! Network works good (if you have the right network card - that is or you virtualize), and even a few flash files are playin!
 
so basically, if you want to go back to the past (to play some flashy games that sucks a\*\*) windows nt 3.51 is sure an interesting approach. not too new, but not too old either. but i guess the border you can't cross with NT 3.51 is still on Macromedia Flash 8. It wont go beyond that, since Flash 9 needs lots of crypt32 DLLs as i tried to start the exefile that came with it. at least it works for my case.
 
another thing is: i cant install netscape 6 on NT 3.51. i wonder why. it always says that i have 0kb free space but it needs a few megs. i guess the DLLs wont get their values from the calls. so maybe nt 3.51 is still too old for netscape 6 or 7. (which is logical).
 
the other idea with the dos enhancer, i will try that too. its a pretty good idea.
as for OS/2.. mh nah, i tried that system one time in the past. but even almost 16 years ago it felt out of place for me. if you put it like this and go beyond the borders of using M$ and DOS, you can even send me to the holy halls of Linux where i stick probably forever with redhat linux 6.2 =D well, maybe i try this too someday.
 
I have been using my samsung tab for drawing and have been trying to find a way for me to animate using macromedia flash 8, but whenever I try to use the drawing tool it just kind of makes the screen move. I cant find any fix for this, and it wont let me draw on my laptops touch screen either unfortunately. Havent found anything related to the problem with many people online yet with a similar enough problem with a solution as well, but I'll continue looking.
 
Could be because Micromedia Flash 8 was released before touchscreens became a thing and simply doesn't work with them as it was not programmed to do so, it is a software from 2005 after all. Keep looking someone might have figured out a solution.

I have experienced this too when running Flash 8. I think I resolved it by going into the **Pen & Windows Ink** section of Windows settings. There should be a list of options you can tick on or off. In Windows 10 there's an option titled "Let me use my pen as a mouse in some desktop apps", that might be the one you want to enable...
 
yeahh Ive been looking into older drawing tabkets that were released before and around the time that macromedia flash 8 was released, luckily none of them are extremely expensive so thats my second option if I cant get it to work :)
