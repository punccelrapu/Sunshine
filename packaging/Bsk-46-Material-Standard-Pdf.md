Over 12,800 ASTM Standards operate globally. Defined and set by us, they improve the lives of millions every day. Combined with our innovative business services, they enhance performance and help everyone have confidence in the things they buy and use.
 
The Recycled Material Standard (RMS) enables participating brands and suppliers to celebrate their sustainability efforts that collectively advance the use of recycled materials. The standard establishes requirements necessary to assure accuracy and transparency of claims with the support of a robust third party certification system.
 
The RMS partners with leading brands, retailers, and suppliers who are eager to impact change by incorporating higher amounts of recycled content or supporting investments in recycling technology as part of in their business models.
 
The RMS has worked with industry leaders to develop two independent tracking system options supported by third party auditing integration to ensure that all use of recycled materials adhere to robust standards.
 
RMS Certification was built on a number of important factors, focusing on clear rules, definitions, and guidelines to create an even playing field among competitors and a strong assurance mechanism for brands and consumers. Not only can supply chain participants have confidence in their claims, they can join an educational platform to grow and share their knowledge of the benefits of recycled materials.
 
The main body of the label provides specific information about the material type and clarifies whether the claim refers to the product or the package. Supporting full transparency, different claims will be used depending on whether the claim is based on average volume (x%), a mass balance allocation, or the purchase of ARCs.
 
Conscientious consumers can learn more about the RMS labels and claims by visiting the website. The label ID number will reference the specific company that produced the product or package and is listed in the certificate database.
 
But a ver big problem is how reverse this operation, I mean from Standard Shader to C4D Shaders.... Why? When yo export an scene in FBX with Arnold Shaders Materials applied seems that any assignation will be preserved. But with C4D standard materials all assignations become stored in FBX file.
 
This is a big problem if you have hundred of Arnold shaders materials assigned and you need pass those assignation throught FBX files. I have not found a method to convert an Arnold Shader to C4D material, It's not necesary preserve Arnold Shader appareancy (altought a random color by each C4D material restored would be great) in this case with a solid it's ok if like me you only need preserve material assignations.
 
The FBX contains the Standard Surface parameter settings? I'd be surprised. 

Sounds like you need to replace a do-nothing stub material with a CINEMA 4D material, so you don't need any Arnold-specific expertise, just CINEMA 4D scripting?
 
No, FBX seems not store any Arnold Shader assignation from C4D. If you open FBX saved from a file with Arnold Shaders applied to objects, you can see that is like none material assignation was be applied.
 
If you need export fbx and need sort objects by material assignation and you had work with Arnold Shaders you are in a problem. Unless you have a Cinema 4D script to revert all Arnold Shaders to Standard C4D materials (due that this assignation are preserved in FBX).
 
If I understand correctly your goal is to preserve the material assignments in the FBX and the look is not relevant. What's your workflow? Where and how do you use the FBX? Does it have to be FBX? Arnold supports MaterialX to export material assignments (looks).
 
I need a fbx file with material assignments due that I import scene to TwinMotion (Unreal engine) and in this step I can sort all assets by materials. So I only need apply a material once time in TwinMotion... Think about if you need reapply "glass" material on every window of a big house or hotel... In my case this tedious work was done in C4toA, if you need to do again due material assignment are not preserved in FBX... you need do it twice.
 
Please check the attached script. It will iterate over the objects and replace the assigned Arnold materials with C4D materials. If the Arnold material has a standard\_surface root shader, it will use its base color in the C4D material, otherwise the look is not preserved.
 
Setting sceneViewportRescale to something like 8 will make the image very blurry but will stress the difference on mobile. I might apply 2 to some phones. Note however that this messes with mouse coordinates (eg for picking).
 
Correct shade is all about correct lighting. You have to set correct lighting on your final scene incl. ibl to make PBR looks good. The difference come from that fact that the PBR uses different light attenuation approach, which is more correct I think.
 
I used side-by-side image comparison to fine tune lights so PBR scene looks like my source Java3D scene with standard materials. The result is acceptable. Just use **mat.unlit = true** to compare with original color when tuning lights.
 
The only downside with PBR materials is their roughness, which can make some tint in the color. But this issue affects in most cases only very dark and de-saturated materials (yes - the shades of particular color).
 
Hello All, I created and released a standard cost estimate for a group of materials. After releasing I realised that the cost is not correct. How can I rerun /override the standard cost extimate of those materials and change the exisiting cost in the same period. As SAP does not allow to re run the standard cost in the same period twice. I hope somebody of you might have faced the above scenario and would like to know how did u approach this. Thanks Dev
 
The notes I took say: It does not delete the standard but it allows you to redo it. Delete the period/fiscal year, planned price itemization and then you can recost the product. You may have to manually adjust material transactions.

I'm creating a scheduling agreement and have already maintained a standard price for this material on MMR ( Material Master Records). However when I create scheduling agreement the prices are not getting populated from the MMRs.
 
Just wanted to clarify that we aren't maintaining info records or a source list for the vendor and material combination. I've tried creating the scheduling agreement with info records and it does pull the price from the info records.
 
I've always thought that if an info records is present in the system the prices gets copied from the info records if the info record is not present then the price from the MMR will get copied over on the scheduling agreeemnt.
 
Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect and should I need any other COPY control config to have material standard price pulled over in scheduling agreement without having info records or source list.
 
Note : Whatever price maintained in material master, it will be used to valuate the stock or inventory. E.g. if you have maintained standerd price of "X" materail as 10USD & you have 10 nos of "X" in your store then you can say, that inventory value of "X" material is 10\*10=100USd
 
Material standards are a set of established criteria that define the quality, composition, properties, and performance requirements of materials used in various industries and applications. These standards are developed and maintained by organizations such as national or international standards bodies, industry associations, and regulatory agencies to ensure consistency, safety, and reliability in material selection and usage. Some notable organizations are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). These standards can encompass a wide range of materials, such as metals, plastics, and textiles. They provide detailed information on factors such as chemical composition, mechanical properties (like strength and hardness), electrical properties, and other relevant characteristics.
 
Material standards help manufacturers and suppliers maintain consistent quality in their products by providing guidelines for material testing, inspection, and certification processes. These standards ensure that materials used in different products or components are compatible and can function seamlessly together. This is especially crucial in industries such as the electronic industry. These standar
