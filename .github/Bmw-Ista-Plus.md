That sunny space was small, and I needed so much: flowers, herbs, fruit, a charcoal grill; my requirements for sanity. You could not move on it without bumping into something, but I was happy.

In early fall, at the end of the growing season, our black cat, Vince, and I piled into a sewing machine-sized Zipcar and followed the moving van that contained our belongings and all my terrace plants across the Brooklyn Bridge and north, into Manhattan.
 
I shivered. I nearly lost my mind. Mentally, I bonded with suicidal Norwegians. To stay sane, I shopped for seeds online, and plotted what lily bulbs to plant where. I wondered how much summer sun the terrace would receive.
 
And among the dead there were survivors. The blueberry bush was visited by local bumblebees, and is loaded with more berries than ever before. Either it likes the hard pruning I gave it after fruiting, or the fresh coffee grounds I use as a mulch. Or perhaps Harlem bees are better. The black raspberry has lots of green fruit. The two surviving roses are fat with buds. The narrow built-in planters are stuffed with my former terrace herbs, tough customers: chives, thyme, sage, oregano. The strawberries made it, too.

I have learned about the light. The sun arrives at noon and leaves at four. No one panics anymore when I light fires. My plants are growing (May helps). There are flowers and meals to come. And I have enough mint for a million mojitos.

Seed testing is key in preventing movement of pests by seeds and should be conducted for detection of pests identified based on defined scientific criteria. The ISTA Reference Pest List (ISTA-RPL) summarises scientific knowledge on the possible dissemination of pests through seeds in non-vegetable plant species. The ISTA-RPL is centered on seed-borne and seed-contaminating pests (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, viruses, nematodes), and more particularly aims at identifying pest-host combinations where seed is a pathway of dissemination. Other diseases or disorders (i.e., invasive plant species or insects) are not covered.
 
The project covers more than 50 non-vegetable species from 25 botanical families, including cereals, legumes, oilseeds, forest trees, and fruit trees. The ISTA-RPL will be updated regularly as soon as a list is finalised.
 
It also includes a list of pests that were included in the latest version of the Annotated list of seed-borne diseases (4th ed.; 1990), but which have no evidence to be seed-borne or seed-contaminating pests in the scientific literature. They will be regularly checked for information.
 
**Selection and review of articles**: some were initially selected by Christine HENRY and Alex JEBB (FERA, UK), Terry AVELING, Nicole JOUBERT, Godfrey KGATLE, Edgar MANGWENDE, Gloria MUKWIRIMBA and Renaan THOMPSON (University of Pretoria, South Africa). Since 2018, the scientific literature is screened by Nicolas DENANC. He coordinates international experts, with recognized expertise in seed pathology and from examination offices, seed companies, and academic research laboratories. They are involved in the evaluation of the selected articles.
 
**Contact**: If you have comments on the conclusions or new information to offer, please contact ISTA (ista.office@ista.ch). Readers are encouraged to subscribe to ISTA Newsletter to stay tuned on further updates.

My mother-in-law saw it and said they had the exact same set from the exact same store and decade *weird*and we were welcome to it. I knew I had struck gold here. Whenever you can have multiples you create a more cohesive look which in turn feels more purposeful and less hand-me-down. So yes, not looking so great above, but with a few changes, the sets went from dated to timeless.
 
I was able to order fabric samples and then build my cushions and pillows, picking every last detail. Add ons like piping and tufting make a huge difference in the look, and those are all completely customizable. These more lounge-y chairs were huddled around a fire pit table at our last house. The table had seen better days but the chairs were still in good condition *minus the cushions*so I broke them into two sets to form little seating areas. The button tufting is my favorite. For something hollywood regency I could have gone with black buttons, but I stuck with white for a more traditional feel.
 
No space is complete without a little styling, and the best way to achieve a comfortable outdoor area is to treat it like an indoor one. Rugs, potted plants and mood lighting in the form of candles and string lights will go far. A mirror will open up the space, add depth and bring in extra sparkle.
 
I love that you reused the outdoor dining tables and chairs. I think that vintage vibe is fantastic, plus those are cast iron right? They'll last forever! We have a big 6-top table and chairs like that, we love them, although they need repainted!
 
In each property, the conditions and metering equipment are different. Our extensive range of products and solutions for consumption measuring, meter reading and billing of costs for cooling, hot & cold water and electric is tailored to the individual needs.
 
In times of increasing energy costs, it is important to measure and control energy consumption accurately. We meet our costumers' requirements by offering a variety of highly advanced cooling metering instruments.
 
The BTU meter comprises of a flow measurement sensor, two temperature sensors and a microprocessor based energy calculator. The Flow Sensor shall be installed in chilled water return lines in the direction of the chilled water flow either in vertical or horizontal position. The two temperature sensors, one sensor shall be installed on return line and the second sensor shall be installed in supply line. The quantity of thermal energy transferred from the cooling water to the consumer over a defined period of time is proportional to the temperature difference between the flow and return and the volume of cooling water that has flowed through.
 
The cooling/heat meter generation ultego III with their different series and sizing provides a multitude of combination and application possibilities. The compact version ultego III smart plus and the modular type perfect III range consists of a calculator, flow sensor and temperature sensors. The calculators can be removed and mounted separately and the two external sensors specified at a number of lengths to meet all requirements. Both series can be provided with a number of integrated communication modules and are compliant to the European Measuring Instruments Directive MID.
 
ultego III consists of a flow measuring section with two integrated ultrasonic sensors and an electronic calculator with bus output and a lithium battery. The battery life is 10 years plus one year reserve. Flow meters with a nominal flow rate from 3.5 to 60 m3 / h can be delivered.
 
**Water meters** measure individual water consumption. Whether hot or cold water, in the kitchen, bathroom or cellar, in a new build or old building: we have the appropriate version for every field of application.
 
All meters connected to the symphonic M-bus system can be read centrally: either directly on the spot or by data transfer to an external central control. This improves the quality of life for your tenants, and enables you to monitor the energy balance of the building more flexible.
 
With Spashionista I hope to share all of my passions expressed in my town with my physical limitations at my stage in life. That includes fashion and trends and giveaways geared towards older, curvier, and disenfranchised woman. But it also includes a glimpse at life in Nashville, which is one of the fastest-growing, cosmopolitan cities in the southern US, and a steady push towards social awareness and acceptance of the disabled. I believe a narrative that advocates for positive, lasting social changes can be entertaining as well as enlightening.
