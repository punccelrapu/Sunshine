I've tried using the scripts as the guides say with remote play and all but 99% of the time vivi just jumps once and fails. I looked it up and the most updated videos say you should use septomor's script while adjusting the latency but i only got 20 jumps once and then it was back to one jump every time even with the same amount of latency. Does anyone know what i might be doing wrong? I heard you have to adjust the framerate and the resolution on remote play but i'm on ps4 pro and the latest version of remote play will only give you an option to adjust regular ps4 resolution and framerate. It gives you resolution and framerate according to your connection speed on ps4 pro. I have a 250 mb connection if that helps and both my ps4 pro and pc are directly connected to the router via ethernet if that helps.
 
You'll likely need to mess about with the latency, don't worry if it doens't work initially, let it run a few times before change latency, it seems to be a bit temperamental, sometimes it'll go to 100 jumps, other times it'll do as it sohuld ang hit 1000+

Hi Man, I am trying to do it with the new Jump.ahk, but the issue is when I press start it shows the word start but it dose not start if I press Ctr Esc it exists. So I think I am unable to start the script.
 
Forgive my ignorance, and potential lack of reading, but I'm struggling to even get a script to properly run to the point where I can start worry about latency.

1. I'm using an older Remote Play as many suggested. Downloaded each of the softwares. Using the newest script.

2. Can't save script files so they have an "H" file image. If I do, and try to open it, it gives me an "Error: Function calls require a space or "(". Use comma only between parameters." I'm confident this is my issue, I just don't know what to do here.

3. I can open the non-"H" versions, but only through the "AutoHotkey Unicode 32-bit" program. In general, I can't run these as admin, but I can get the menu where I select which script and press Start.

4. I get a little box that says "Start" and then it starts counting. It does nothing to the game. Nothing I press influences this. Pressing "t," "esc", etc doesn't work. I can press "Enter" to have Vivi talk to the girls, so keyboard functionality with Remote Playe works.

Any help and tip would be greatly appreciated!
 
Way rarer, it's already rare as it is but it takes a long time, took me 18 hours jumping rope, the jump between 200 and 300 jumps is unholy, and took me another 20+ hours farming enemies, I only did it because I truly love FFIX.

Yes, I did get it to work! I did have to use the older version of AutoHotKey (it has the option to download/install older versions right in the program). I was racking my brain trying to figure it out when I first attempted this. Weeks later when I decided to try again, I stumbled upon this option within minutes and gave it shot ? Thank you for your clarification! No wonder I couldn't get it to work before. Hopefully, our exchange can help others!

670 was the magic latency in my case. Took two attempts for the script to get it at that point. I was still on the older version of Remote Play, on wifi, and made no other changes (like to my resolution).

Hello. Can someone please help me out.
I have run the script with the following settings, but Vivi will not talk to the girl and start jumping.
The script seems to be running and the numbers are increasing.
It seems that AutoHotkey is not working for remote play.
 
I followed the guide and ran the script, couldn't, there was an error in the script it said and it wouldn't work at all. I dug up a different jump script, the script said the code was made for an older version of the program when i tried running it,windows automatically downloaded the older version and still wrong, syntax errors or something. Went back to the old script, now I have a unique window that pops up when I run the script.
 
Now I assume I start it at 0 with vivi standing in between the girls and I click start on the script box then X on my controller and it should work right? Wrong, does nothing, I see a small windows text box counting sometimes but it does seem to detect somethings failing. Can't get it to go past one jump, I'm assuming it's not seeing the remote play window at all.
 
I download an older version of remote play, still nothing. I GO BACK to the newest version of remote play and I notice that it sizes the window to a specific resolution and places it in the corner, I guess somewhere it's reading the screen to see if it failed or not but no actions are actually being sent to the program. I spent a half hour figuring out why I can't just run the script at all, the guy just double clicks the .exe in the video and it just works yet mine explodes.
 
Just trying to make some idiot in a video game jump for me, whats the point of all these githubs and all this programming if it DOESN'T WORK!? Guess I'm shelving the game till a working program gets made.
 
If you're signed in to your controller then that means remote play isn't signed in (at least on PS5). Your controller will be turned off if it's set up right. You'll need to use the enter key on your keyboard to get to the right position for the script to run. The script will start the jumping from you in the position with the exclamation mark above your head. Enter key is just to get you back to the start if you're part way through the process.
 
Edit: you may have your controller connected to the device running remote play so ignore that bit if that's what you meant, but either way the script will start the game, you don't need to press X, and may be effecting the timing by manually starting it.
 
KennyFF92s post here works if you follow it exactly: -is-jump-script-method-even-possible-these-days/?page=3. you'll still need to play with the latency to get it to 1000 but the process is sound. The only thing I found is it had to run the Remote Play .MSI file, not the .exe as I got installation errors on Windows 10.
