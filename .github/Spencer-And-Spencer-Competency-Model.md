Increasing attention is being directed to the competency of those who deliver healthcare in the United States. In behavioral health, there is growing recognition of the need to define, teach, and assess essential competencies. Since attention to this issue in behavioral health is relatively recent, there is much to be gained by learning from the principles, definitions, and conceptual models of competency that have been developed in other fields. This article outlines the forces that drive the current focus on competency of the healthcare workforce. Relevant history, principles, definitions, and models that have evolved through research and application in business and industry are reviewed. From this analysis, recommendations are offered to guide future work on competencies in behavioral health.

Patient safety and quality care are issues of major concern for nursing and all health care professions. Initiatives driven by these concerns have been undertaken during the past decade by organizations and agencies at the local, state, and national levels. One comprehensive framework used by many schools and agencies is Lenburg's Competency Outcomes and Performance Assessment Model (COPA). This article explores the basic concepts and related principles that are fundamental in refocusing the curriculum to promote practice-based competence. The framework emphasizes eight core practice competencies; competency-based outcomes; practice-driven learning; and competency performance examinations. The article also highlights Klein's doctoral research, which compares the effects on teaching and learning in a sample of diverse nursing programs, some of which use and some that do not use the model. Key findings are summarized with recommendations for further study. The COPA Model also is briefly compared to an emerging competency initiative.
