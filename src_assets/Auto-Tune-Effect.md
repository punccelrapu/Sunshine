**Auto-Tune**, or **autotune**, is an audio processor software introduced in 1997 by the American company **Antares Audio Technologies**.[1][4] It uses a proprietary device to measure and correct pitch in vocal and instrumental music recording and performances.[5]
 
Auto-Tune was originally intended to disguise or correct off-key inaccuracies, allowing vocal tracks to be perfectly tuned. The 1998 Cher song "Believe" popularized the technique of using Auto-Tune to distort vocals. In 2018, the music critic Simon Reynolds observed that Auto-Tune had "revolutionized popular music", calling its use for effects "the fad that just wouldn't fade. Its use is now more entrenched than ever."[6]

Auto-Tune is available as a plug-in for digital audio workstations used in a studio setting and as a stand-alone, rack-mounted unit for live performance processing.[8] The processor slightly shifts pitches to the nearest true, correct semitone (to the exact pitch of the nearest note in traditional equal temperament). Auto-Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitch is raised or lowered significantly,[9] such that the voice is heard to leap from note to note stepwise, like a synthesizer.[10]
 
Auto-Tune was developed by Andy Hildebrand, a Ph.D. research engineer who specialized in stochastic estimation theory and digital signal processing.[1] Hildebrand conceived the vocal pitch correction technology on the suggestion of a colleague's wife, who had joked that she could benefit from a device to help her sing in tune.[13][14]
 
Over several months in early 1996, he implemented the algorithm on a custom Macintosh computer and presented the result at the NAMM Show later that year, where "it was instantly a massive hit".[13] Hildebrand's method for detecting pitch involved the use of autocorrelation and proved superior to earlier attempts based on feature extraction that had problems processing certain aspects of the human voice such as diphthongs, leading to sound artifacts.[13] Music engineers had previously considered autocorrelation impractical because of the massive computational effort required, but Hildebrand found a "mathematical trick" to overcome this, "a simplification [that] changed a million multiply adds into just four".[13]
 
According to the Auto-Tune patent, the referred implementation detail consists, when processing new samples, of reusing the former autocorrelation bin, and adding the product of the new sample with the older sample corresponding to a lag value, while subtracting the autocorrelation product of the sample that correspondingly got out of window.[5]
 
Originally, Auto-Tune was designed to discreetly correct imprecise intonations to make music more expressive, with the original patent asserting: "When voices or instruments are out of tune, the emotional qualities of the performance are lost."[6] Auto-Tune was launched in September 1997.[1]
 
Aphex Twin's song "Funny Little Man" from his "Come To Daddy (EP)" mini-album was one of the earliest published songs to utilize Auto-Tune, being released less than a month after Auto-Tune's initial release.[1][15][16] The song "Fragments of Life" by Roy Vedas was released on August 17[17] and made the top 100 UK singles chart near the end of August.[18] The Kid Rock song "Only God Knows Why" from the album "Devil Without a Cause" was released on August 18.[19] Both songs extensively use Auto-Tune distortion.

Auto-Tune was popularized by Cher's 1998 song "Believe".[20] While Auto-Tune was designed to be used subtly to correct vocal performances, the "Believe" producers used extreme settings to create unnaturally rapid corrections in Cher's vocals, thereby removing portamento, the natural slide between pitches in singing.[21] In an attempt to protect their method, they initially claimed the effect was achieved using a vocoder.[21] It was widely imitated and became known as the "Cher effect".[21]
 
According to *Pitchfork*, 1999 "Too Much of Heaven" by Italian Europop group Eiffel 65 features "the very first example of rapping through Auto-Tune".[22] The group's member Gabry Ponte stated that their usage of the effect was inspired by Cher's "Believe".[23]
 
The English rock band Radiohead used Auto-Tune on their 2001 album *Amnesiac* to create a "nasal, depersonalized sound" and to process speech into melody. According to the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, Auto-Tune "desperately tries to search for the music in your speech, and produces notes at random. If you've assigned it a key, you've got music."[24]
 
In the mid and late 2000s, musician T-Pain used Auto-Tune extensively, further popularizing use of the effect.[25] He cited the new jack swing producer Teddy Riley and funk artist Roger Troutman's use of the talk box as inspirations for his use of Auto-Tune.[20] T-Pain became so associated with Auto-Tune that he had an iPhone app named after him that simulated the effect, "I Am T-Pain".[26] Eventually dubbed the "T-Pain effect",[14] the use of Auto-Tune became a fixture of late 2000s music, where it was notably used in other hip hop/R&B artists' works, including Snoop Dogg's single "Sexual Eruption",[27] Lil Wayne's "Lollipop",[28] and Kanye West's album *808s & Heartbreak*.[29] In 2009 the Black Eyed Peas' number-one hit "Boom Boom Pow", made heavy use of Auto-Tune on their vocals to create a futuristic sound.[14] The use of Auto-Tune in hip hop gained a resurgence in the mid-2010s, especially in trap music, with artists like Future, Playboi Carti, Travis Scott, and Lil Uzi Vert using Auto-Tune to create a signature sound.[14][30]
 
The effect has also become popular in ra music and other genres from Northern Africa.[31] According to the *Boston Herald*, country stars Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Tim McGraw use Auto-Tune in performance, calling it a safety net that guarantees a good performance.[32] However, other country music singers, such as Allison Moorer,[33] Garth Brooks,[34] Big & Rich, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill and Martina McBride, have refused to use Auto-Tune.[35]
 
At the 51st Grammy Awards in early 2009, the band Death Cab for Cutie made an appearance wearing blue ribbons to protest against the use of Auto-Tune in the music industry.[36] Later that spring, Jay-Z titled the lead single of his album *The Blueprint 3* as "D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)". Jay-Z elaborated that he wrote the song under the personal belief that the trend had become a gimmick which had become far too widely used.[37][38] Christina Aguilera appeared in public in Los Angeles on August 10, 2009, wearing a T-shirt that read "Auto Tune is for Pussies". When later interviewed by Sirius/XM, however, she clarified that Auto-Tune could be used "in a creative way" and noted her song "Elastic Love" from *Bionic* uses it.[39]
 
Opponents of the plug-in have argued that Auto-Tune has a negative effect on society's perception and consumption of music. In 2004, *The Daily Telegraph* music critic Neil McCormick called Auto-Tune a "particularly sinister invention that has been putting extra shine on pop vocals since the 1990s" by taking "a poorly sung note and transpos[ing] it, placing it dead centre of where it was meant to be".[40]
 
In 2009, *Time* magazine quoted an unnamed Grammy-winning recording engineer as saying, "Let's just say I've had Auto-Tune save vocals on everything from Britney Spears to Bollywood cast albums. And every singer now presumes that you'll just run their voice through the box." The same article expressed "hope that pop's fetish for uniform perfect pitch will fade", speculating that pop-music songs have become harder to differentiate from one another, as "track after track has perfect pitch."[41] According to Tom Lord-Alge, the device is used on nearly every record these days.[42]
 
In 2010, the reality TV show *The X Factor* admitted to using Auto-Tune to improve the voices of contestants.[43] Also in 2010, *Time* magazine included Auto-Tune in their list of "The 50 Worst Inventions".[44]
 
I'm not a perfect note hitter either but I'm not going to cover it up with Auto-Tune. Everybody uses it, too. I once asked a studio guy in Toronto, 'How many people don't use Auto-Tune?' and he said, 'You and Nelly Furtado are the only two people who've never used it in here.' Even though I'm not into Nelly Furtado, it kind of made me respect her. It's cool that she has some integrity.[45]
 
Used by stars from Snoop Dogg and Lil Wayne to Britney Spears and Cher, Auto-Tune has been widely criticized as indicative of an inability to sing on key.[46][47][48][49][50] Trey Parker used Auto-Tune on the *South Park* song "Gay Fish", and found that he had to sing off-key in order to sound distorted; he claimed, "You had to be a bad singer in order for that thing to actually sound the way it does. If you use it and you sing into it correctly, it doesn't do anything to your voice."[51] Electropop recording artist Kesha has been widely recognized as using excessive Auto-Tune in her songs, putting her vocal talent under scrutiny.[47][52][53][54][55] Music producer Rick Rubin wrote that "Right now, if you listen to pop, everything is in perfect pitch, perfect time and perfect tune. That's how ubiquitous Auto-Tune is."[56] *Time* journalist Josh Tyrangiel called Auto-Tune "Photoshop for the human voice".[56]
 
Ellie Goulding and Ed Sheeran have called for honesty in live shows by joining the "Live Means Live" campaign. "Live Means Live" was launched by songwriter/composer David Mindel. When a band displays the "Live Means Live" logo, the audience knows, "there's no Auto-Tune, nothing that isn't 100 per cent live" in the show, and there are no backing tracks.[58]
 
In the 2023, multiple creators on the social media platform TikTok were accused of using Auto-Tune in post-production to correct the pitch
