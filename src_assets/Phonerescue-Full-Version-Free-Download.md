Hi I used the free version of Phonerescue 4 on my iPhone with iOS 13.1 or 13.2 (Can't remember). I disconnected it early because I changed my mind (So about 500 megabytes). I want to know if anyone thinks it installs malware to your iPhone, I updated to the most recent version right after. I did see that it does actually find deleted data based on what I saw. I have seen positives and negatives from people and I also I downloaded it from the actual site. I haven't had any issues so far on my mac or phone but still... I also had my security software up that blocks malicious dns as well. Do you think malware got installed on my phone and uploads data to a server?
 
I haven't actually read any positive reviews about it on any of the reputable websites, and I always refrain from adding any Antivirus or AntiMalware software because I just can't rely on any of it. It's just that I don't trust them.

Hi. I purchased the software and installed it. I'm running PhoneRescue on iPhone X and it seems to be working, but it is downloading TONS of data and filling up my computer (Note that I ONLY checked the "Messages" box. I have 35 Gigs of available space, and it is FILLING it. Am I doing something wrong? Or can I set it to download the data to an external hard drive? Thanks for your help!

i found, on my Mac's log in items, an AnyTrans start up item. I was there because my computer was acting crazy. I ran Avast AntiVirus program and it flagged it as code from an outfit called MacClean from China, and it's definitely MALWARE. I looked up the company that puts out MacClean. They're in China. They install their code on your computer and create problems, and charge you money to fix it. I think I got rid of it in time, but if I'd done it myself it just would have reinstalled itself over and over again.
 
I also learned that some companies are in partnership with this outfit, and bundle it in their software. Does AnyTrans bundle "MacClean" in it's software, or did they hijack the AnyTrans I purchased without your involvement?
