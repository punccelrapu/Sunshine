Gmail has become our secondary ID for most of us on the interwebs today, serving as our go-to platform for both personal and professional communication. Losing access to our Gmail account can be a distressing experience, as it hampers your ability to connect with contacts and access important emails and data.

And sometimes, the situation becomes even more complex when you encounter difficulties in reaching the phone number or recovery email associated with your account. But you can skip the freak out phase!
 
Add a phone number and recovery email to your Google account to avoid future password recovery troubles. If you have similar problems in the future, restoring access to your report will be simpler, thanks to these extra recovery alternatives. Take these steps:
 
To add another level of protection during the password recovery procedure, Google allows users to create security questions. You may more quickly authenticate your identity and obtain access to your account by providing accurate answers to these questions.

Your Gmail account has an additional degree of protection thanks to two-factor authentication. When signing in, you must provide your password and a second verification number if you use 2FA. This code is usually created by an authenticator app or transmitted by SMS to your mobile device. The extra authentication step that 2FA demands makes it far more difficult for unauthorized users to access your account.
 
Ensure the recovery email address and phone number linked to your Gmail account are current and correct. If you forget your password, you may use these recovery alternatives to get back into your account. Check and update your contact information in your Google account settings often to make sure it is accurate.
 
Never share or keep your password in a location where it is readily accessible. Use a password manager, which securely saves your passwords and enables you to create and maintain robust, individual passwords for several accounts. Password managers provide access to an encrypted vault where you may store your passwords, offering additional security against unwanted access.

AFAIK no serious email client stores accounts passwords.
If you have forgotten your ISP account password for eM Client, then you should go to your ISP website and ask to reset that password. Then update that in eM Client.
 
If you are using oAuth, typical with Gmail, there is no password used in eM Client. Access to your Gmail account will continue regardless of how many times you change the password on the server. You do not need to change anything in eM Client.
 
Thank you.
Mysteriously my phone did pick up the eMClient emails today. It must have pulled the information from my old phone in the transfer but took a long time to process as it also did with se3veral other programs.
I was at the interface page originally and it appeared that I could change the password there but I was apprehensive about doing it. Thanks again.

I recently forgot mty gmail account password and I can't recover it either so I was hoping that I firefox has saved my passwords in the account I created and synced with. but when I sign in mozilla asks me to verify the account but this is not possible in my situation. What should I do?
 
Hi, sorry. With out you logging in with your stuff to do so. That Can and will not happen, also Support does not have access to your Sync information or account.Suggest you go to google login page and request a new password for your address and it will be sent to your alternate address as you should have oneas the questions asked will lead to that result.That is the place to start. Good Luck.
 
I did everything I could to reset the password the gmail account password but I couldn't. The passwords stored on the Firefox account was my last chance of getting that email back. I saw the questions about confirming Firefox account and there were some reasonable answers but in my opinion it really is unnecessary.I have another Firefox account that might have contained such information but I forgot the password to the account and I had to reset it. Is there anyway to recover the info on that account?
