At the end of last season, the Charmed Ones saved the world when Macy took on the power of The Source and defeated Alastair Caine. With the elders gone, magical creatures flocked to the Vera house to appoint the trio in their place. Though the sisters had struggled all season with whether they wanted the responsibility that came with their powers, they seemed hopeful and ready to take them on. That was short-lived.
 
That said, I do like the way they have used that darkness as a source of strength for her. It is that darkness that allowed Macy to take on The Source and not be destroyed by it. It was her acceptance of it that allowed her to take control of it. And that darkness is what kept the trio alive in this episode. Going forward, I expect her relationship with that power to grow but I hope it is not at the expense of her humanity or her goodness.
 
My hope is that they will truly embrace their roles as the Charmed Ones and de facto Elders. They, again, made a conscious choice to continue this work. They were given an opportunity to walk away and chose not to. Let them relish in being powerful, magical women and spend less time pining for normalcy.
 
*Charmed* premiered on The WB on October 7, 1998 and ended on May 21, 2006, with 178 episodes. Charmed originally aired on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm, before moving to Thursday nights for its second, third and fourth seasons. For the fifth season, the series moved to Sunday nights at 8:00 pm and remained there until its eighth and final season.
 
The first episode, "Something Wicca This Way Comes", garnered 7.7 million viewers and broke the record for the highest-rated debut episode for The WB. During its fifth season, Charmed became the highest-rated Sunday night program in The WB's history. By the end of its eighth season, Charmed had become the second-longest drama broadcast by The WB. In addition, on January 22, 2006, with the airing of the episode "Payback's a Witch" of the eighth season, *Charmed* became the longest running hour-long series in American television history featuring all female leads. However, this accolade was surpassed by *Desperate Housewives* in 2012.

The complete DVD collection for *Charmed* was released on November 18, 2008. For region 2, a 'complete' collection set already existed which had free space to add season 8 later. Various other complete collections were released until they went out of print. In 2014, the series was re-released in a new box-set.
 
**Season 4** is the fourth and final season of *Charmed*. The show was renewed for a fourth season on February 3, 2021 by The CW. There were a total of 13 episodes.[1] The season premiered on March 11, 2022.[2] The series was cancelled in May 2022 after four seasons.[3][4] The season and series concluded on June 10, 2022.
 
On February 3, 2021, The CW made the early decision to hand renewals to 12 current series, with president and CEO Mark Pedowitz sticking with stability as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on network's schedules, the development process and pilot season.[5]
 
On August 27, 2021, it was reported that *Charmed* would once again change showrunners and creative direction starting with season four. The husband-wife duo, Liz Kruger and Craig Shapiro, would be replaced with Jeffrey Lieber, Joey Falco and Nicki Renna as the new showrunners.[7]
 
Everything changes when Michaela (**Lucy Barrett**), who goes by Kaela, is introduced as the third Charmed one. Kaela is apprehensive about joining the sisterhood as well as embracing her magic. As the season progresses, she becomes more accepting of her role in the magical world and eventually moves in with the Veras.
 
One of the best parts of this season was how the writers dived deep into the larger lore to create their final villain. In the original **Charmed**, we got hints and pieces about the previous incarnations, however, the reboot put the past Power of Three front and center. Inara (**Nazneen Contractor**), one of the original Charmed Ones, believes that the only way to save the world is to control it. She works hard, using others, to absorb the power of Three all for herself. However, like a good well-rounded villain, her redemption arc is complete by the end of the series.
 
The dynamics between Inara and her two sisters create a fantastic foil for the conflicts that Kaela, Maggie, and Mel have. Kaela struggles throughout the entire series about her place in the family structure, feeling that the blood bond between Mel and Maggie is stronger than the magical sisterhood provides. Seeing their sisterhood stand the test of Inara and the original Charmed Ones brought tears to my eyes. For the final episode alone, a season five should have been greenlit right away.
 
After saving the world, Mel, Kaela, and Maggie found themselves transferred through a portal onto a porch that looked oddly familiar. Walking into the front door together, the door swung closed as if by magic. The camera pans out to show us the house from the original **Charmed** series. While the shot of the entire purple victorian house brought tears to my eyes, I knew where the sisters were the moment I saw the stained glass window in the front door.
 
The cliffhanger will haunt me for the potential of what it could be. It would have been amazing to have the new Charmed Ones crossover with the Charmed Ones from my childhood. I wish that we could see this play out in what was sure to have been an epic season five. The reboot has been criticized many times for ignoring the reboot, however, the ending celebrates the original **Charmed** in the most epic way. For now, the doors are closed on that opportunity. At least for the time being.
 
This show, along with so many other shows on The CW, was canceled way too soon. Having watched **Charmed** from its first episode to its last, I only wished that we had more time with it. The stars have poured their hearts and souls into the show, so cutting it prematurely was like losing a best friend.
 
After Charmed wrapped its first season back in May, the series switched showrunners and there was a big fuss made over changing the focus to be more about supernatural storylines. This raised alarms for me. The original Charmed started going downhill after creator Constance M. Burge stepped back and let Brad Kern take over, switching the focus from sisterly bonds to supernatural costume changes and petty squabbling.
 
However, I was willing to give it a chance. Since the season finale was about Mel, Macy, and Maggie taking over for the Elders as leaders of the magical community, focusing on supernatural stuff felt like a natural way for things to go in season two. Keep calm and Harry on, right? Boy was I nave.
 
I did like how they explained away the loss of other Whitelighters, as it makes sense that if the Elders died out they would too. It also explains why Harry is still around, since he was no longer attached to them. On that note: How does Harry manage to keep getting hotter?
 
**The show weaved together many magical storylines** which vary in success. Some were remembered as iconic, while the fandom universally maligned others. Multiple main characters in Charmed, like Leo, were praised, while others, like Wyatt, got the short end of the stick. Similarly, some seasons of Charmed were held up as the pinnacle of the series, while others weren't as beloved.
 
Charmed season 1 was exceptionally well written, introducing audiences to each of the Halliwell sisters and their interpersonal dynamic. Rather than the characters immediately reconciling their differences, the writers give the trio time to work through their issues and grow closer. The season sets up the series-long romance between Piper and Leo, building up their connection before revealing the whitelighter-witch romantic conflict that would remain in place throughout most of Charmed.
 
This series is one of the rare examples of a TV show that avoided a sophomore slump, with Charmed season 2 exceeding season 1. The show offered immense character development, allowing the Halliwell sisters to break out of their shells in their personal lives while also growing as witches. **Leo and Darryl, two fan favorites, bumped up from recurring to main characters** in Charmed season 2, adding extra excitement to the series. The scripts had a refined quality, honing in on the unique voice and personality of Charmed.
 
From 1998 to 2006, audiences were charmed (puns!) by a collection of powerful sisters and their impressive magical abilities. The appropriately named Charmed (streaming now on Peacock) starred Alyssa Milano as Phoebe, the youngest Halliwell sister; Holly Marie Combs as Piper, the middlest Halliwell sister; and Shannen Doherty as Prue, the oldest and most powerful Halliwell sister.
