Booking jetskis online was so easy! And free parking!! They fit you into life vests and give you a 5 minute safety speech, which was very clear and explained very well. They took us all into open water and we had a ball! What fun! I LOVE how safe these guys are!

These guys were AWESOME! And I don't say that often when I do reviews in general. Great service, great atmosphere, very personable, and they made the ride was super fun! If you want to parasail, choose Adventure Parasail!
 
We had an AMAZING experience with these guys! In addition to the two adorable pups, they are an incredibly kind family business and provided a great time for us with the jet skis. After an awful experience in Clearwater beach Florida, we were hoping to find a jet ski rental in Virginia that would be fun, let us roam free, and have good customer service attitudes. Rudee inlet jet ski rentals was all of that and more, they even gave us our $10 picture for free. 10/10 and we will be back again.

Best Part of our Vacation!" Great customer service, friendly boat staff. First time for our girls and they felt safe the entire trip. Trip was about 2 hours (12 minute para-sail ride). Bring towels and sunscreen as there is no cover on the boat. Nice site seeing trip on the boat to/from site. "

What a BLAST!" We have gone parasailing before in Siesta Key but we just used Parasail Siesta for our trip and it was awazing. Kizza, Max and Dylan were great. They were obviously experts at what they do but were also fun and informative about thr area. We will be using Parasail Siesta next year FOR SURE!!! "
 
Best part of our Siesta trip" The gracious and informative office staff, the super efficient parasailing team and the stellar boats made our family very relaxed and happy that we were about to take our first parasailing trip. The ethereal experience above, at sunset time that followed, just made it the highlight of the trip. One of our friends who went recently after us also found the team and experience simply superb. Thank you Terry, Nicole, Eric and Savannah and wish you a very happy new year ahead ! "
 
Great Parasailing Experience!" Went out with Kizza and Ricky who were very knowledgeable and engaging. The boat and equipment looked well maintained and everyone had a great time. The guys even took time to get dolphins to play in the wake of the boat on our way back to the dock. Thanks for a great day. "
 
So I pursued my Captain License and got a job with a Parasail boat manufacturer. A dream come true. I spent the next several years working for the company traveling around the world setting up parasail operations and training captains the skills needed to run a parasail operation.
 
I landed in the Virgin Islands in 1992 where I assisted three parasail operations before finally purchasing my own company after a year. Over the next 22 years I grew the business to 7 parasail boats. We became the only parasail operation in St Thomas and our customers consisted of large companies such as Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Marriott Hotels, Ritz Carlton, Starwood Resorts, Rockefeller Resorts, Wyndham Resorts and many other small properties. It was not unusual for us to provide 200 to 300 parasail rides in a day.
 
Over the 20+ years in St Thomas I had many Parasail Captains work for the company. Some came to us with Parasail experience but many worked as Parasail crew and worked hard for their sea time. We trained and developed them into Parasail Captains.
 
On November 15th, 2011 I was in Florida with my kids when the phone rang. It was the most experienced Captain we had on the phone. He was calling to inform me that what I thought could never happen to my company had happened.
 
He had a major incident and a loving mother and wife had been killed, her daughter had been critically injured. My heart sank and time stood still. A million thoughts went through my head. How could this happen? We were the best damn Parasail Company in the world. No one had more experience than us or better safety protocols. I often thought as a Parasail business owner- what is the worst case scenario? Of course a major accident like this would be horrible, but I thought we had all this covered and that this type of tragedy could not happen on my watch.
 
Now what happens? Well, to start, we immediately had the tour suspended from all the cruise lines and major resorts. I spent the next seven full days dealing with USCG investigators, local investigators, insurance investigators, and cruise lines investigators. The USCG came to our office and seized records, took pictures and looked over equipment. Staff members, as well as myself, were interrogated and completed reports for hours at a time. Very grueling, emotional time for my whole team.
 
It did not take long for the lawsuit to follow. I knew it was coming and rightfully so. A lovely mom, wife, sister was gone, and her lovely daughter was very seriously injured. No amount of money would ever compensate them for their loss. I think about them daily.
 
Not only does he have to live with the fact that this happened because of his bad judgment call, but he has to relive the whole event regularly, which has been etched into the minds of both he and his crew forever.
 
Count 1 (Misconduct or Neglect of Ship Officer) the Captain of vessel within the meaning of Title 18, United States Code , Section 1115, did by his misconduct , negligence ,or inattention to his duties on said vessel, cause the death of another person.
 This statute is well over 100 years old and not developed for Parasail companies, but the industry has had too many incidents happen and the USCG decided to use this tool to get the industries attention.
 
The Captain faced 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine. The corporation also faced a $250,000 fine. Now a Captain of parasail boats can make pretty good money, but the cost to defend you against these kinds of charges is huge and not many Captains have the budget to defend themselves against the United States Federal Government. The thought of a 28 year old Captain being sentenced to 10 years in prison for a making a bad judgment call on the weather is a scary one, and as one can see, life changing.

My daughter and I had a great time flying. We ended up being the only ones on the boat. The people that took us know made us fell safe even thought the water was rough. It was so fun would do it again.
 
This is a seriously fun activity. But the team at UFO made it so much better. If you haven't parasailed before, this is the team you want. Their instructions were calm, confident and simple. Their execution was flawless. Most of all, they really know what they are doing and have a lot of fun doing it.
 
The crew was absolutely amazing! Our ride was incredible. Super smooth going out and coming back in. Since it had been my birthday a few days prior, the crew gave us a few 'birthday dunks' prior to coming back into the boat. I cannot say enough good things about this crew and the trip!
 
This was my first time doing parasailing for me and my wife. X-Treme parasail team was very polite and made me and my wife feel safe and comfortable. Thumbs up they did a great job, next time I'll do a 1000 feet.
