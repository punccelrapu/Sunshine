The PS Vita has been hacked wide open, and some of the stuff you can do with it will amaze you. The most recent mod methods allow any firmware to be modded, and you can still go on PSN to download your purchases. The process for the mod varies depending on the firmware that's currently on your Vita, but it's simple enough, and the console becomes an indispensable travel companion once you've modded. Highlights include:

The process works on any Vita (at the time of writing) , so turn off auto updates or use airplane mode to stop your Vita updating. Check the firmware version in the consoles settings page. If you have 3.60 firmware that is the easiest, but all the mods are fairly simple. If your vita prompts you to update, don't do it until you have read the guide.
 
A Vita on firmware 3.60 it is very easy. You use the web browser on the Vita itself to visit and the mod is installed by clicking the "install" button. That's it. The mod remains in place until you fully power off the console, but you can download a program called Enzo, to make the mod permanent. That way, you don't need to go back to the Henkaku website every time.
 
If you are above 3.60 already or accidentally updated past 3.60 there's now a newer mod method called H-Encore which allows **any** version of the Vita to be modded, so you can follow that process instead.
 
Once your console is modded, you can access all the files on your console and memory card using a programme called VitaShell, which also allows connection to your computer via FTP or USB. You can insert your SD/USB into the PC as normal to copy files, or leave them in the console and FTP /USB across. All your downloads are usually single \*.VPK files and you install them by clicking on them in Vitashell and that's it! There's also a brilliant Homebrew Browser that makes the process simpler, working like a storefront for Homebrew, which downloads and installs stuff automatically. There's even a homebrew version of Konami's PT.

I was in two minds over getting rid of my Vita which I was holding on to for this purpose, but the likelihood of cheap memory card adapters and the like was slim, so I sold it. Would love this to replace my old PSP as it does everything the PSP did and a lot more. If the hackers can crack the 3.60 limit and make all firmware hackable that's it, boom.
 
I don't do as much mobile gaming these days (unless I'm on long train journeys or something, I guess), and the PC serves as a decent emulation machine at home - however, I have tried Henkaku before and it's very easy to set up and use. Things like SNES, MD and GBA games play well, and FBAlpha opens up a bunch of arcade titles.
 
Just a quick note: the linked-to video links to a 3.68 hack from the 1st but in just a week the process had already become much faster. The following video is a week younger than the 1st July vids, is crystal clear and comes with a packaged .exe to do all the tricky stuff for you. I was done in 4 minutes instead of 30.
 
What sort of processing power increase does the Vita have over a stock PSP? I know you could overclock a PSP to get some emulators running a bit smoother at the expense of battery life. I assume the Vita handles all the old 8 and 16 bit systems easily enough, but what about things like GBA?
 
I would love someone to confirm with me about this as I haven't had the time to conclusively try myself. The PSP mod allows overclocking and the emulation scene is well established. The Vita also allows overclocking and plugins have recently appeared, and of course the Vita is a more powerful machine to start with so it should be very capable. However at the moment I find that Retroarch isn't quite as good for SNES emulation as Vita Snes9X, and Gameboy Advance has a little slowdown in comparison to Vita MGba. However I remember GBA emulation being pretty spot on for the PSP. Basically, Vita Retroarch is a good one stop shop but the specific individual emulators are better. But some of these are still beaten by their PSP equivalents, but I assume this is because they have been worked on longer.
 
However you can create a Vita Live Area bubble for PSP apps, so it's easy to install a GBA emulator for the PSP onto your Vita, using Adrenaline, then create a bubble for the GBA emulator. That way, you get the benefits of the better emulation with the decent Vita Screen, and you dont have to load Adrenaline first.
 
It is weird that in some ways the PsP emulators are better than their Vita equivalents, but Vita Homebrew has only recently happened, and it's only a month since you could mod any firmware Vita so I assume that the Vita emulators will soon outclass their PSP equivalents.
 
I forget the name of the app but there was a PSP GBA emulator that worked pretty well. The one thing I never tested on PSP was SNES - because everyone mentioned the performance - but it seems fine on Vita.
 
I did the henkaku thing back when it first emerged, but had to give it up in order to play legit PSN games. I'm glad a new exploit has been found, and hopefully if a new firmware blocks it in future, I can work around that. I've still got lots of Vita games I want to buy, but love using this thing for retro shit as well.
 
I managed to get NONPDRM and PKGI installed and downloading, but the games wouldn't install. Fiddled with config and now my Henkaku's b0rked! Nothing loads - Vitashell, PFBA, PKGI, nowt. I'm such a dumbass. So now i'm intending to scrub my installs and start again. Thank god it's a quick/simple process.
 
One thing I will add, that video in the first post says to install QCMA on your PC first, but the latest version of h-encore does it for you. So now I think I've got two copies of the same thing installed on my PC, but never mind.
 
I need to investigate the best emulators for various things. My go-to is always Megadrive first. GenesisPlusGXVita only reads zipped ROM files? Weird. RetroArch is fine but I hate the interface and don't understand half the settings.
 
Any thoughts why for me PFBA is slow on the stuff I like? Contra is unplayable because it is so slow, yet pacland is perfect. Some games are much more technically advanced and run better than simple stuff.
 
Yeah, it's a completely mixed bag. Street Fighter Turbo Alpha 2 worked perfectly, Pang 3 worked perfectly. Contra is terrible. CPS1 and 2 all seem fine, and yet some very old basic games really struggle.
 
Is Master System emulation particularly tricky for any reason? SMSPlusVita (or whatever it's called - the native Vita version) has very sped-up music and slightly squashed aspect ratio (vertically stretched a little), compared to how Fusion handles it on PC.
