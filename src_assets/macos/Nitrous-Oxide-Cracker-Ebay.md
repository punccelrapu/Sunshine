At less than $60 I'm not too worried about getting a killer power increase or if either one or both of these add-ons don't make much of a seat of the pants difference. More so concerned if for some reason it's dangerous or detrimental to the bike.
 
I have Put NOS on a Qt close to 20 years ago . If you want to do it on the cheep buy a Whip cream maker or seltzer maker and use the 8 gram cartridges .You can stack a few in the seltzer maker back to back back so that you can get up to 10- 15 seconds of nitrous per pull .Run the hose from the seltzer nozzle into the oil inject line and run premix 25 to 1 in the tank. Rig up a bike brake cable to the lever so you don't have to take your hands off the bars to activate it .That way you will at least be holding on with two hands when you seize your shit in full tuck .

This is a ton of info on boost bottle calculations . You can see that even the smallest ones require a hose almost the diameter of the spent cartridge so don't expect to be able to tune anything worth a dam with them for a 50cc motor ..and from my memory a single cartridge would only really provide about 3 sec at full rpm of boost so that little thing mounted to the handle bars is better suited for the rider to inhale than the engine .
 
I noticed the boost bottle in that kit is only 20cc from a reused nitrous container and I'd like mine to match the 49cc so I'll prob look else where for the equipment, especially if I can make it work from the whipped cream cartridges. Having to stack multiple cartridges for 15sec worth or having short burst cartridges doesn't strike me as a bad thing at this stage as I'd rather only have a short shot while I'm learning the best tune/setup for the bike.
 
Don't waist the time with the boost bottle . Read the link I posted . It will only operate in a small rpm range that you will need to tune it to ...like a expansion chamber on the pipe just sticking some crap inline with a tube aint gun do shit .Look up YEIS from the yamaha YZ bikes and you will find a little more info if you want to learn more about it .You could just run the line into the foam filter or tap the case and run it into the crank ....Either way just know ...every time you hit that NOS you are taking years off your bike for seconds worth of performance .
 
I pretty regularly take years off my own life for a little fun (: so taking them from my simple dime-a-dozen 50cc Yamaha motor doesn't rub me the wrong way to badly. I should add tho that I don't plan on cruising this everyday and hitting the nitrous a few times each ride, more like maybe a couple times a year total for less than 10sec when some other moped in my town gets alongside me.
 
I do want to thank you for your points about the boost bottle. I think I already didn't want to bother making that for a tiny increase in power with an obtrusive bottle somewhere, and was hoping someone would tell me what I want to hear. Not too mention it would need to be increased when I go 60cc this summer which seems like the best way to spend my $100 total or whatever budget on the bike this season. Looks like I should stick to reeds/pod filter/exhaust/60cc as my main plan and have the nitrous as a fun option in my pocket.
 
If you are willing to do the math and have a dead spot in your mid range power you are trying to overcome the boost bottle will be able to help with that .. But its not a universal thing that you are going to buy of ebay ,Bolt on and ride down the street in a wheelie from .The N2o you will notice .The 20cc cartridges they are selling with the kit are likely just the whip-it cartridges re labeled .....

Damn I like that idea, the extra shot of oil could maybe be a good insurance policy against all that extra combustion. I might be a bit worried about that high pressure working back to the pump but it I'd hope it would follow the path of least resistance.
 
Oh yea buddy that's def the box for me, hopefully it'll help convince my lady to find a few other uses for that whipped cream haha. I think I'll leave the boost bottle alone, I really didn't like the idea of toting around a strange ugly tank somewhere not too mention I weigh less than 150 so the bike can already pull me up any hill and I don't notice any one region of my powerband lacking in relation to another. Good to know I can keep the idea in my back pocket if future mods give me a flat spot (edited)
 
If you have a budget to blow these are an awesome way to get N2o on a motor . I have put them on sleds before and they are rather universal . This holds enough that it would probably last the life of your motor on one fill
 
The oil pump is a hydraulic gear style pump . It would take more that a few psi to reverse the flow . Keep in mind that also when you add N20 you are increasing the "Air" portion of your AFR . Intern you will be running much leaner when you are on the N2o. To make that worse .. in your gas portion of your AFR is mixed oil that your motor needs to survive ...so now you are lean on the fuel and lean on the oil ...and high in the rpm range .. So jet on the heavy side for your main and mix it 25-1 with the oil ...
 
That mess of reasons is exactly why I thought the idea to T into the oil line was quite genius to give a little extra squirt before things get dry, I think I'd only run the no2 with something like 25-32:1 in the tank on top of the pump bc any extra squirt I get has to then be bled out in the oil line which pumps crazy slow, I wouldn't really mind being a like smoky the rest of that ride then draining the tank so I don't get a ton of extra carbon. In addition to retaining more of the stock equipment if I T in rather than straight to the nipple.
 
I've been looking for a good dispenser and I can't seem to find a real cheap one that doesn't have a huge bottle for holding the cream. The little head shop jig things they have for people huffing no2 seem to be activated by screwing a lid down so def not something I could trigger or adapt a line into the output.
 
From that 6sigma company on eBay I can buy just their nitrous cracker and button without the boost bottle and all their zip ties and tubing for less than $30 which is cheaper than the whipped cream stuff and it's way smaller. I really like that it has the size of a simple huffing cracker that fills a balloon but doesn't just dump the whole bottle and has button release like a whipped cream bottle
 
How are those triggered and is there any way to run a line from those? Most other ones I've seen are simply screwed in fully and dump out of the several top holes into a balloon stretched over top. Can't imagine hooking a line to that before attempted to screw it together and getting the full few sec dump while getting frostbite on my hand.
 
I think I've got a lead on a suitable dispenser. They make these tire inflators that run off of the little c02 cartridges for around $15 that use a lever to deploy the bottle until the button is released. Hits all three requirements for price, button, and partial deployment.
 
Although these appear to be made from those. I guess I'm going to stop posting about it and just get one for $10 and roll the dice. My only beef now is how to get a line output from the Schrader valve that I assume needs positive pressure on it to dispense. I really like the form factor vs a cream bottle and a basic balloon cracker is unsuitable for this task.
 
the single cartridge is going to be very disappointing in longevity . Like I said .You will only get maybe 3 seconds from that at WOT. Its only 20cc ....Its a 50cc motor rotating at 10k..........say you need 5% of the air its using to be replaced wit N20...... How many rotations will that provide you with
 
That 20cc is of high pressure liquid I would imagine expands a great deal when dispensed, in addition to the fact that I plan on using a 16g cartridge which may still be the 20cc you speak of. It would also be entirely feasible to install two of the unit to get a second shot.
 
The largest point here is that I'm not looking for a perfect NASA engineered $100+ killer nitrous system capable of squirting me down the 1/4 mile and blowing my shit up. The cost of a case of beer getting me a 6sec power blast at WOT for shits and giggles with homemade supplies is what I'm after, preferably something that's easy to take on/off when I'm in the mood but keep off the bike the rest of the time.
 
It would look like they are using a modified co2 inflator, def not going with the 6sigma kit as they won't sell out of bundle but I've found their exact cracker from China on eBay for under $10 and in the US for just over $10. The only thing left to solve at this point is finding a model that has the Schrader valve thread on so it can be removed and I can bypass having to press down to open the fitting on to dispense
 
Their site also has much better single piece aluminum boost bottles for under $20 just in case my future mods result in a flatspot in my powerband, def only something to consider after doing exhaust which is known to kill the low end although hopefully my light weight makes it a non issue cuz those bottles really are ugly.

The nitrous oxide in whipped cream chargers is used by recreational drug users as an inhalant for its psychoactive effects and now by car enthusiasts for its power adding effects. Chargers are also used as a cheap source of nitrous oxide for small, powerful model rockets and soon they'll be a cheap source of power for your car.
 
Unlike automotive grade nitrous oxide, food grade nitrous oxide contains no additives so it's more potent so you don't need as much. A box of 100 of these cartridges can be bought for a mere $37.96 on Amazon and that's more than enough for a weekend of fun.
 
Best of all, these cartridges are tiny, so they can easily be hidden u
