When the English language initially adopted the word, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project became known as an "object". Every project has certain phases of development.

Project cancellation is the termination of a project prior to its completion and generally includes the cessation of access to funding and other project resources. Project cancellation may result from cost overruns, schedule overruns, changes in budget, change or obviation of the goal of the project, political factors, or any combination of those and other factors. Contracts often stipulate the time and the manner in which a project may be cancelled.
 
A project is an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned and researched about by students. At schools, educational institutes and universities, a project is a research assignment - given to a student - which generally requires a larger amount of effort and more independent work than that involved in a normal essay assignment. It requires students to undertake their fact-finding and analysis, either from library/internet research or from gathering data empirically. The written report that comes from the project is usually in the form of a dissertation, which will contain sections on the project's inception, analysis, findings and conclusions.[8]

In civil, military and industry (e.g. oil and gas) infrastructure, capital projects refer to activities to construct and install equipment, facilities and buildings. As these activities are temporary endeavors with clear start and end dates, the term "project" is applied. Because the results of these activities are typically long-standing infrastructure, with a life measured in years or decades, these projects are typically accounted for in financial accounting as capital expenditures, and thus they are termed "capital projects".
 
In computer software, a project can consist of programs, configuration definitions and related data.[*citation needed*] For example, in Microsoft Visual Studio, a "solution" consists of projects and other definitions.[12]
 
It can be defined as "a set of state policies and/or agencies unified around a particular issue or oppression".[13] Therefore, these kinds of projects involve constant change and dynamism due to the social constructions that evolve among time. State projects have to adapt to the current moment. They are mostly community services based.
 
In the context of infrastructure code, a project is a collection of code used to build a discrete component of the system. There is no rule on how much a single project or its component can include.[14]
 
There is a one-to-one relationship between a Project and a "build.gradle"file. During build initialisation, Gradle assembles a Project object for each project which is toparticipate in the build, as follows:
 
A project is essentially a collection of Task objects. Each task performs some basic piece of work, suchas compiling classes, or running unit tests, or zipping up a WAR file. You add tasks to a project using one of thecreate() methods on TaskContainer, such as TaskContainer.create(String). You can locate existingtasks using one of the lookup methods on TaskContainer, such as TaskCollection.getByName(String).
 
A project generally has a number of dependencies it needs in order to do its work. Also, a project generallyproduces a number of artifacts, which other projects can use. Those dependencies are grouped in configurations, andcan be retrieved and uploaded from repositories. You use the ConfigurationContainerreturned by getConfigurations() method to manage the configurations. The DependencyHandler returned by getDependencies() method to manage thedependencies. The ArtifactHandler returned by getArtifacts() method tomanage the artifacts. The RepositoryHandler returned by getRepositories() method to manage the repositories.
 
Plugins can be used to modularise and reuse project configuration.Plugins can be applied using the PluginAware.apply(java.util.Map) method, or by using the PluginDependenciesSpec plugins script block.
 
Gradle executes the project's build file against the Project instance to configure the project. Anyproperty or method which your script uses is delegated through to the associated Project object. Thismeans, that you can use any of the methods and properties on the Project interface directly in your script.
 
For example: defaultTasks('some-task') // Delegates to Project.defaultTasks() reportsDir = file('reports') // Delegates to Project.file() and the Java Plugin You can also access the Project instance using the project property. This can make thescript clearer in some cases. For example, you could use project.name rather than name toaccess the project's name.
 
When reading a property, the project searches the above scopes in order, and returns the value from the firstscope it finds the property in. If not found, an exception is thrown. See property(String) for more details.
 
When writing a property, the project searches the above scopes in order, and sets the property in the first scopeit finds the property in. If not found, an exception is thrown. See setProperty(String, Object) for more details.
 
Sets the build directory of this project. The build directory is the directory which all artifacts aregenerated into. The path parameter is evaluated as described for file(Object). This mean you can use,amongst other things, a relative or absolute path or File object to specify the build directory.
 
If the file exists, it will be evaluated against this project when this project is configured.Returns:the build script for this project.getParent@NullableProject getParent()Returns the parent project of this project, if any.
 
Returns the name of this project. The project's name is not necessarily unique within a project hierarchy. Youshould use the getPath() method for a unique identifier for the project.If the root project is unnamed and is located on a file system root it will have a randomly-generated name
 
Returns this project. This method is useful in build files to explicitly access project properties andmethods. For example, using project.name can express your intent better than usingname. This method also allows you to access project properties from a scope where the property maybe hidden, such as, for example, from a method or closure.
 
Creates a Task with the given name and adds it to this project. Before the task is returned, the givenclosure is executed to configure the task. A map of creation options can be passed to this method to control howthe task is created. See task(java.util.Map, String) for the available options.
 
Locates a project by path and configures it using the given closure. If the path is relative, it isinterpreted relative to this project. The target project is passed to the closure as the closure's delegate.
 
Resolves a file path to a URI, relative to the project directory of this project. Evaluates the provided pathobject as described for file(Object), with the exception that any URI scheme is supported, not just'file:' URIs.
 
The returned file collection is lazy, so that the paths are evaluated only when the contents of the filecollection are queried. The file collection is also live, so that it evaluates the above each time the contentsof the collection is queried.
 
Creates a new ConfigurableFileCollection using the given paths. The paths are evaluated as per files(Object...). The file collection is configured using the given closure. The file collection is passed tothe closure as its delegate. Example:
 
The returned file tree is lazy, so that it scans for files only when the contents of the file tree arequeried. The file tree is also live, so that it scans for files each time the contents of the file tree arequeried.
 
Executes the given closure against the AntBuilder for this project. You can use this in yourbuild file to execute ant tasks. The AntBuild is passed to the closure as the closure'sdelegate. See example in javadoc for getAnt()
 
You can access this property in your build fileusing convention. You can also access the properties and methods of the convention objectas if they were properties and methods of this project. See here for more details
 
Passes the project to theaction as a parameter. Actions passed to this method execute in the same order they were passed.A parent project may add an action to its child projects to further configure those projects basedon their state after their build files run.
 
Creates a container for managing named objects of the specified type. The given closure is used to create object instances. The name of the instance to be created is passed as a parameter tothe closure.
