I am looking for a full user manual for the DG3450 Digital Gateway Modem -- which my cable provider/ISP (Sparklight) just installed in my house. I have searched every nook and cranny of the ARRIS web site and there is no reference to the model number. On the web there is exists draft copies of a User Guide but it does not cover topics like Port Forwarding or DynamicDNS setup. Someone at ARRIS must know about this product.
 
The aim behind this special line of commercial grills is to achieve a perfect cooking result, occupying less space in the kitchen. The Grillvapor Compact Grills are smaller than the normal Grillvapor Grills, but still retain all the culinary and economic advantages guaranteed of the Grillvapor technology. For products of the Grillvapor compact line, the water tray is filled and emptied manually, the controls are simple and intuitive, and the units are ideal for placing on tables and/or refrigerated bases without affecting the cooling system, so that food can be grilled to perfection even in the smallest of kitchens.
 
Positioned on refrigerated bases, Grillvapor compact units help to improve the efficiency of kitchen staff, speed up production, and minimize the movements that staff are required to make. Grillvapor compact units are also available on open or enclosed cabinets. Ideal for food trucks and for mobile caterers.
