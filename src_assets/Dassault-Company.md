It was founded in 1929 by Marcel Bloch as Socit des Avions Marcel Bloch (Marcel Bloch Aircraft Company) or "MB". After World War II, Marcel Bloch changed his name to Marcel Dassault, and the name of the company was changed to **Avions Marcel Dassault** on 20 January 1947.

The Socit des Avions Marcel Bloch was founded by Marcel Bloch in 1929.[3] In 1935 Bloch and Henry Potez entered into an agreement to buy Socit Arienne Bordelaise (SAB), subsequently renamed *Socit Aronautique du Sud-Ouest*.[4] In 1936 the arms industry in France was nationalised as the *Socit Nationale de Constructions Aronautiques du Sud Ouest* (SNCASO). Marcel Bloch was asked to act as delegated administrator of the Minister for Air.[5] During the occupation of France by Nazi Germany the country's aviation industry was virtually disbanded.[6] Marcel Bloch was imprisoned by the Vichy government in October 1940. In 1944 Bloch was deported to the Buchenwald concentration camp by the German occupiers where he remained until it was liberated on 11 April 1945.
 
On 10 November 1945, at an extraordinary general meeting of the *Socit Anonyme des Avions Marcel Bloch* the company voted to change its form to a limited liability entity, *Socit des Avions Marcel Bloch*, which was to be a holding company. On 20 January 1947 *Socit des Avions Marcel Bloch* became *Socit des Avions Marcel Dassault* to reflect the name adopted by its owner.
 
In 1954, Dassault established an electronics division (by 1962 named *Electronique Marcel Dassault*), the first action of which was to begin the development of airborne radars, soon followed by seeker heads for air-to-air missiles, navigation, and bombing aids. From the 1950s to late 1970s exports become a major part of Dassault's business, major successes were the Dassault Mirage series and the Mystere-Falcon.
 
In 1965 and 1966, the French government stressed to its various defense suppliers the need to specialize to maintain viable companies. Dassault was to specialise in combat and business aircraft, Nord Aviation in ballistic missiles and Sud Aviation civil and military transport aircraft and helicopters.[7] (Nord Aviation and Sud Aviation would merge in 1970 to form Arospatiale which would itself later merge with 2 other firms and become EADS (now Airbus)).
 
On 27 June 1967, Dassault (at the urging of the French government) acquired 66% of Breguet Aviation. Under the merger deal Socit des Avions Marcel Dassault was dissolved on 14 December 1971, with its assets vested in Breguet, to be renamed Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA).
 
In 1979 the French government took a 20% share in Dassault and established the Societ de Gestion de Participations Aronautiques (SOGEPA) to manage this and an indirect 25% share in Aerospatiale (the government also held a direct 75% share in that company). In 1998 the French government transferred its shares in Dassault Aviation (45.76%) to Aerospatiale. On 10 July 2000, Arospatiale-Matra merged with other European companies to form EADS (presently Airbus).

In 2000 Serge Dassault resigned as chairman and was succeeded by Charles Edelstenne. Serge Dassault was appointed honorary chairman. The American company Atlantic Aviation based in Wilmington, Delaware, was acquired in October 2000.
 
The latest step in educational excellence is marked by a new Purdue partnership with multinational software giant Dassault Systmes, a leader in providing virtual twin experiences for global industries. A memorandum of understanding was signed Friday (Feb. 16) with the company as part of a campus visit and tour by Dassault Systmes, who met with representatives of Birck Nanotechnology Center, where students learn the latest semiconductor technology in preparation for joining the workforce amid high demand for skilled industry workers.
 
The move is the latest in an ever-expanding list of global partnerships and initiatives that Purdue has forged to build the collaborative network that will define the future of semiconductor, nanoelectronics and digital technologies research and development at Purdue.
 
Purdue is a national leader in microelectronics materials, devices, chip design, tool development, manufacturing, packaging and sustainability, spanning the semiconductor ecosystem in software and hardware with long-standing faculty excellence.

Shortly before the press conference, the Little Rock Airport Commission approved an amended lease agreement that will add 4.36 acres to the 130 acres Dassault Falcon already leases, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The amendment would allow the company to add about 24 more acres by 2030 if needed for the expansion.
