I pride myself as being something of a rare breed: I'm a person with a conscience and a sports fan. I don't typically like seeing athletes sustain injuries; where the whole 'troubled conscience' really comes in is when you see a player sustain a head injury, or worse yet, a spinal cord injury. We've learned a lot about head injuries and concussions over the recent years, what with hundreds of former players suing the league over the issue, claiming the NFL didn't do enough to protect players from known risks associated with head injuries and concussions.
 
All too often now, in football and in other physical sports like hockey, we're hearing about a rapid degradation of the quality of a person's life, often leading to drug and alcohol addiction, erratic behavior, and much more.

Here's where I often think about former Buffalo Bills safety Mark Kelso. Many a night do I lie in my fine bed and think about things, and every so often I think about Kelso and the giant helmet he wore for those early '90s Bills teams. He looked out of proportion and silly with that giant egg on his head. Announcers called him a conehead. In hindsight, he should be called a pioneer.
 
In a column that ran almost two years ago, ESPN's Gregg Easterbrook wrote about Kelso and former San Francisco tackle Steve Wallace, focusing on their use of an innovative helmet to help them avoid concussions.
 
This is pretty amazing stuff that becomes only more apt by the day in the wake of near-weekly reminders of this crisis in the news. I have a sneaking suspicion that Kelso's and Wallace's experience with concussions and improved helmets is being studied by both sides of the ongoing litigation.
 
But in at least one case, the players are their own worst enemies. The technology exists to place a sensor in the helmet to measure the force of impact of any given hit, and perhaps act accordingly upon that information. Which may lead to precautionary, involuntary benching during a game. The players want none of that.

I don't have the technical expertise to know why the whole league doesn't follow the Kelso-Wallace model, and create a softer external area on the outside of the helmet that can absorb impact. You often hear of players returning from concussions with improved helmets.
 
Personally, I'm happy Kelso is still with the Bills as John Murphy's radio color man. I think he does a professorial job illuminating defensive schemes. And I love laying in bed at night and dreaming of his ridiculous helmet, and hoping there's a way for football to be played without regularly resulting in potentially catastrophic injury.
 
As a PILOT what u can do is "up" on george command so he salves ur HMD, then enable CPG info on TSD/map, then use CAQ on map and drop it on the CPG - TADS position. now you should have a PLT symbol on the TSD/MAP and under coords T55 is your PLT point. Which u could then use as an ACQ point or what ever.
 
Or do it this way up" on George command so he salves ur HMD TSD-> ATK mode -> point ->ADD and then move the courser over TADS pos and then press coursor enter, in ATK mode it will automaticly create target point starting at t01. advantige of this method is of course that u can easely set up multiple points.
 
Note that you will need to be in range and ask george to shoot so he can shot the laser and get the range of the target. Otherwise the mark of the TADS on the TSD will point in the direction of the target but it won't be in the correct distance.
 
Hoping to get some help on storing. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I'll lase a target, hit the store button on left handgrip, and I don't see anything pop on the COORD page. I've tried different combinations of holding the lase button down and pressing the store button. Also followed up with the update button as well, but no luck. I've watched Wag's TADS video several times too.

An icon of deep sea diving, the Mark V Dress represents the early 20th century innovation in marine technology that enabled divers to work at significant depths for the first time. It was used by the U.S. Navy from 1916-1984, and is still used in the commercial industry in environments with especially strong currents.
 
Weighing a little over 55lbs, the Mark V helmet and breastplate are made of spun copper and tobin bronze. The helmet is screwed down a quarter turn onto the breastplate, which is attached to the canvas dress with four brails. The hat has four glass ports, including the front faceplate, which opens outward.
 
Used for buoyancy control, the leather weight belt keeps the diver submerged when his lungs expand during natural intake of breath, and as the dress inflates. The belt is attached with adjustable harnesses and a crotch strap, and its lead blocks weigh a total of 84lbs.
 
The hat has four glass ports, including the front faceplate, which opens outward. Between the faceplate and side port, the spit cock allows the diver to suck water into his mouth and spit it at the faceplate to defog. Shown in detail: communication port (left) and air port (right).
 
I was browsing through Ebay and I saw this helmet up for sale. I immediately purchased it and while I probably overpayed for it I have no regrets. The helmet came with an OD Helmet cover with a manufacterer's mark, the first I've ever seen one in my short time as a collector.
 
Whoa. I've seen several OD covers, but first I've seen with the stamp. Interesting that this one appears to have been made by a USMC depot. I never thought they had a particular connection to the Marines.
 
So, maybe I'm understanding wrong, but on the above posted covers, the 'DTD' represents the date of manufacture (or maybe contract)...but on the OP's new stamped cover above...the DTD is 1-11-45? It can't be 1945, because the FSN wasn't in use, nor were OD helmet covers. I thought maybe it was a -65, but if you compare it to the other '4' in the FSN...it certainly looks like a 4.
 
Well I think DTD is the date the contract was assigned because I see a whole bunch of them with the same date, and never see ones that are just a few days or a month ahead like I would expect for a mfg date.
 
At the outbreak of World War I, none of the combatants provided steel helmets to their troops. Soldiers of most nations went into battle wearing cloth, felt, or leather headgear that offered no protection from modern weapons.
 
A significant partial exception to this lack was the German *Pickelhaube*. Like other army helmets of 1914, it was made out of leather; but it also had a significant amount of steel inserts that offered some head protection. This included the top spike, originally used to stop strikes from an enemy hand-held sabre.
 
The huge number of lethal head wounds that modern artillery weapons inflicted upon the French Army led them to introduce the first modern steel helmets in the summer of 1915.[3][4] The first French helmets were bowl-shaped steel "skullcaps" worn under the cloth caps. These rudimentary helmets were soon replaced by the Model 1915 Adrian helmet, designed by August-Louis Adrian.[5] The idea was later adopted by most other combatant nations.
 
At about the same time, the British War Office had seen a similar need for steel helmets. The War Office Invention Department was ordered to evaluate the French design. They decided that it was not strong enough and too complex to be swiftly manufactured. British industry was not geared up to an all-out effort of war production in the early days of World War I, which also led to the shell shortage of 1915.
 
Brodie's helmet resembled designs from past eras, in particular the medieval infantry kettle hat or *chapel-de-fer* and the samurai/ashigaru jingasa helmet, unlike the German *Stahlhelm*, which resembled the medieval sallet.[9] The Brodie had a shallow circular crown with a wide brim around the edge, a leather liner and a leather chinstrap. The helmet's "soup bowl" shape was designed to protect the wearer's head and shoulders from shrapnel shell projectiles bursting from above the trenches. The design allowed the use of relatively thick steel that could be formed in a single pressing while maintaining the helmet's thickness. This made it more resistant to projectiles but it offered less protection to the lower head and neck than other helmets.
