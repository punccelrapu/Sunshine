A productive lesson is not one in which everything goes exactly as planned, but one in which both students and instructor learn from each other. You may refer to an example of a 3 hour lesson plan here.
 
Before you plan your lesson, you will first need to identify the learning objectives for the lesson. A learning objective describes what the learner will know or be able to do after the learning experience rather than what the learner will be exposed to during the instruction (i.e. topics). Typically, it is written in a language that is easily understood by students and clearly related to the program learning outcomes. The table below contains the characteristics of clear learning objectives:

When planning learning activities you should consider the types of activities students will need to engage in, in order to develop the skills and knowledge required to demonstrate effective learning in the course. Learning activities should be directly related to the learning objectives of the course, and provide experiences that will enable students to engage in, practice, and gain feedback on specific progress towards those objectives.
 
As you plan your learning activities, estimate how much time you will spend on each. Build in time for extended explanation or discussion, but also be prepared to move on quickly to different applications or problems, and to identify strategies that check for understanding. Some questions to think about as you design the learning activities you will use are:
 
Many activities can be used to engage learners. The activity types (i.e. what the student is doing) and their examples provided below are by no means an exhaustive list, but will help you in thinking through how best to design and deliver high impact learning experiences for your students in a typical lesson.
 
*Presenting students with a problem, scenario, case, challenge or design issue, which they are then asked to address or deal with provides students with opportunities to think about or use knowledge and information in new and different ways.*
 
*The process of reflection starts with the student thinking about what they already know and have experienced in relation to the topic being explored/learnt. This is followed by analysis of why the student thinks about the topic in the way they do, and what assumptions, attitudes and beliefs they have about, and bring to learning about the topic.*

Assessments (e.g., tests, papers, problem sets, performances) provide opportunities for students to demonstrate and practice the knowledge and skills articulated in the learning objectives, and for instructors to offer targeted feedback that can guide further learning.
 
A list of ten learning objectives is not realistic, so narrow down your list to the two or three key concepts, ideas, or skills you want students to learn in the lesson. Your list of prioritized learning objectives will help you make decisions on the spot and adjust your lesson plan as needed. Here are some strategies for creating a realistic timeline:
 
Letting your students know what they will be learning and doing in class will help keep them more engaged and on track. Providing a meaningful organisation of the class time can help students not only remember better, but also follow your presentation and understand the rationale behind the planned learning activities. You can share your lesson plan by writing a brief agenda on the whiteboard or telling students explicitly what they will be learning and doing in class.

Take a few minutes after each class to reflect on what worked well and why, and what you could have done differently. Identifying successful and less successful organization of class time and activities would make it easier to adjust to the contingencies of the classroom. If needed, revise the lesson plan.
 
N2 - With the aim of improving the immersive experience of the end user, High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging has been gaining popularity. Therefore, proper validation and performance benchmarking of HDR processing algorithms is a key step towards standardization and commercial deployment. A crucial component of such validation studies is the selection of a challenging and balanced set of source (reference) HDR content. In order to facilitate this, we present an objective method based on the premise that a more challenging HDR scene encapsulates higher contrast, and as a result will show up more visible errors on contrast reduction. This information is subsequently analyzed via fuzzy clustering to enable a probabilistic interpretation. To evaluate the proposed approach, we performed an experimental study on a large set of publicly available HDR images.

A resume objective is a short and specific statement that defines your current professional goals and why you want to work for that organisation. A well-written one can help to set the tone and focus for the rest of the resume.
 
Finally, a resume objective highlights key information not found anywhere else in your resume. For instance, you might be pursuing a position in a completely different industry, and you need to make it clear why you are applying to a different role.
 
From demonstrating your enthusiasm for the role to why your past working experience is relevant to the position, including one shows why you are keen to grow with the company and how your long-term career goals align with the position.
 
Your objective statement needs to be clear and concise, which is why reducing it down to bullet points can help you to stand out. Hiring managers are busy people, so resume objective statements need to summarise your
 
Go through the job advertisement carefully and pick out skills or requirements that match yours and write one specific to the job role. For instance, if you are a teacher, highlight your teaching experience including subjects and levels taught. With an objective specific to the job role, the recruiter would likely want to know more about you.
 
Many hiring managers and headhunters read only the Executive Summary before deciding whether to move on with a resume or CV. Therefore, include only the key information that they will find interesting. Think of it as a short summary of you as a professional.
 
In this section, you can highlight the key skills, knowledge, and experience that would interest the company. For instance, if you are applying for a position as an electrical engineer, you might wish to highlight your Master of Science degree in Power Engineering.
 
Finally, showing how you can help the company solve a particular problem will increase the likelihood of you being selected over for the next round. An example could be writing a software program that could improve their business processes seven-fold.
 
You can highlight your experience and achievements in your Executive Summary. However, avoid exaggerating them as this does not reflect well on you and might even cause the recruiter to reject your application.
 
Avoid using technical and confusing terms in your executive summary and resume objective. Excellent communication skills include the ability to explain complex situations in simple terms, and your resume should do this too.
 
Numbers give your experiences more weight with fewer words. Including metrics relevant to the position personalises your achievements for the hiring manager and helps you stand out from the competition. Always substantiate your claims with metrics.
 
A strong opening statement is extremely important when describing yourself in a professional manner. Make sure to emphasise your main skills in short, whether this be your analytical skills or your leadership skills.

A **career objective**, also known as a resume objective, is a short statement that gives an overview of what you want to achieve in your professional journey. It's usually two to three sentences long and is placed at the top of your resume, below your contact information. To get noticed and stand out from other job seekers, make the **objective for your resume** relevant to the role you're applying for.
 
If you have limited work experience and are seeking an entry-level position, a strong resume objective will tell your potential employer if you
