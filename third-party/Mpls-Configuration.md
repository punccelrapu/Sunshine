To implement the MPLS feature, you must have a router from the range of Cisco 2600 or higher. To select the required Cisco IOS with MPLS feature, use the Software Research tool. Also check for the additional RAM and Flash memory required to run the MPLS feature in the routers. WIC-1T, WIC-2T, and serial interfaces can be used.

When used with MPLS, the VPN feature allows several sites to interconnect transparently through a service provider network. One Service Provider network can support several different IP VPNs. Each of these appears to its users as a private network, separate from all other networks. Within a VPN, each site can send IP packets to any other site in the same VPN.
 
Each VPN is associated with one or more Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances. A VRF consists of an IP routing table, a derived Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) table, and a set of interfaces that use this forwarding table. The router maintains a separate Routing Information Base (RIB) and CEF table for each VRF. Therefore, the information is not sent outside the VPN and allows the same subnet to be used in several VPNs and does not cause duplicate IP address problems. The router that uses Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) distributes the VPN routing information with the MP-BGP extended communities.
 
2. Configure an IGP on the service provider core, either Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocols are the recommended options, and advertise the Loopback0 from each P and PE routers.
 
Set up the import and export properties for the MP-BGP extended communities. These are used to filter the import and export process with the command **route-target import** as shown in the next output:
 
There are several ways to configure BGP, for example, you can configure PE routers as BGP neighbors or use a Route Reflector (RR) or Confederation methods. A Route Reflector is used in the next example, which is more scalable than the use of direct neighbors between PE routers:
 
In this next sample, the show ip route vrf commands show the same prefix 10.0.6.0/24 in both the outputs. This is because the remote PE has the same network for two Cisco clients, CE\_B2 and CE\_A3, which is allowed in a typical MPLS VPN solution.
 
When you run a traceroute between two sites, in this example two sites of Client\_A (CE-A1 to CE-A3), it is possible to see the label stack used by the MPLS network (if it is configured to do so by mpls ip propagate-ttl ).
 
Hi Wessk : Can you please share current configuration snapshot? Also if you have not configured VLAN over WAN then gateway may not came up. So configured Port4 with LAN or DMZ with any fake IP or network and then over same Port 4 click on add VLAN option and fill the the VLAN ID details given by ISP with VLAN zone as in WAN and fill the other required details given by ISP and this should make your Port4 VLAN Internet gateway status up.
 
Hi Wessk : Thanks for sharing the snapshot. Is gateway status showing up or down? If it is showing down can you confirm gateway IP ARP on XG?

console> sy dia uti arp sh x.x.x.x ( where x.x.x.x is gateway IP). 

You may manually initiate the ARP request to your gateway via console access.
 
If you are looking for an MPLS Tutorial or step by step mpls configuration examples, this basic **MPLS VPN configuration example** will guide you from configuring the first router to a 3 router MPLS core with 2 external sites.
 
The entire tutorial is covered in this video above so if you like to just watch the video is there, if you want to follow along I suggest you open this page twice or print it out so you can make notes.
 
Building the simple MPLS topology below this will consist of a 3 router MPLS core and two remote sites in the same VRF running OSPF as the PE-CE routing protocol. This will be quite a long post as I will be taking you through every single verification along the way to ensure you understand how each section works.
 
So to review we have now configured IP addresses on the MPLS core, enabled OSPF and full IP connectivity between all routers and finally enabled mpls on all the interfaces in the core and have established ldp neighbors between all routers.
 
Virtual routing and forwarding (**VRF**) is a technology included in IP (Internet Protocol) that allows multiple instances of a routing table to co-exist in a router and work together but not interfere with each other.. This increases functionality by allowing network paths to be segmented without using multiple devices.
 
In the next MPLS Tutorial I will add a second customer site into the mix and also go through some MPLS Troubleshooting where I will go through turning off different features and trying to break the MPLS and show you the logical steps to troubleshoot it.
 
Multiprotocol Label Switching (**MPLS**) is a way of routing traffic within a telecommunications **network** that directs data from one node to the next based path labels rather than long **network** addresses, It also allows the sharing of address space for clients as it is labels that are being routed not prefixes.
 
No, MPLS is a method to route networks across a service provider network, routing protocols like OSPF and BGP are used to make MPLS work. MPLS operates using BGP and typically uses OSPF to exchange routes with the customer.
 
You spoke of additional information such as  
In the next MPLS Tutorial I will add a second customer site into the mix and also go through some MPLS Troubleshooting where I will go through turning off different features and trying to break the MPLS and show you the logical steps to troubleshoot it. Im interested in the troubleshooting, where can I find this?
 
Thanks very much, I am just re-learning my way around MPLS so this was a great refresh. I got caught out on GNS3 playing games with me and dropping the LDP config in OSFP so it all looked good except in the core. I am just going to expand out now to BGP but thanks for taking the time to document this so well.

First, we will configure the IGP protocol among all P and PE routers to support LDP and BGP adjacencies within the provider network. Even IGP or static routes might be a choice. We can configure EIGRP, as all routers in our example are from Cisco.
 
Picture 2 depicts the captured traffic on the link between the PE1 and P routers, while pinging from PC1A to PC2B. The outer MPLS label Switching Path (LSP) is 18 and is used for label switching. It is learned via the LDP (Label Distribution Protocol) and has a local significance.
 
The label 21 is the inner (VPN) label, added by the PE1 router. It is used to identify the correct next-hop (10.0.0.18) on the PE2 router for Customer A data traffic. The inner label is kept untouched by the P router. Only the PE routers perform either push or pop of the VPN labels. The VPN label for Customer B traffic is 22.
 
The P router is a transit router that performs pop of LSP labels 18 and 19 (Picture 4). This router takes the forwarding decision solely based on labels. The label 19 is the LSP label pushed on packet by PE2 router when sending traffic to 10.1.1.1.
 
Picture 5 depicts the captured traffic on the link between P and PE2 routers, while issuing the ping command from PC1A to PC2B. There is only one MPLS header with VPN label 21 because the P router has poped the label 18. Router PE2 removes the inner VPN header 21 and forwards ICMP request as a plain IP packet to CE2A (10.0.0.18).
 
In the opposite direction, a packet carrying ICMP echo reply message from PC2A to PC1A contains the LSP label in the MPLS header. The VPN label is the same as in echo request (21) because both sides are customer A. Picture 6 depicts MPLS forwarding table of PE2 router.
 
Picture 7 depicts a forwarding table of the PE2 router for VRF Customer A. It contains two routes learned via BGP. It is the route 172.16.2.0/24 announced by customer router CE2A and the route 172.16.1.0 advertised by the router PE1.
 
BGP Update message sent from PE1 to PE2 is depicted in Picture 8. Notice, that there is only one MPLS header with LSP label 18, VPN label is missing. It ensures that MP-BGP message is sent via the MPLS network. VPN label is distributed inside the MP-BGP update message along with the unique VPN-IPv4 prefix.
 
We have provided the exact configuration steps that can help our readers create a BGP/MPLS L3 VPNs and grasp the overall concept.
