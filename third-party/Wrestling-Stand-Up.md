**In my Sophomore year at Iowa**, we took second at the National Tournament and as a team, we struggled a bit throughout the year. I was the starting 158 lber that year and was having a season with some ups and downs. **My biggest weakness was the bottom position and it caught up to me** one night in Minneapolis.
 

 The devastating effects of not being prepared in the bottom position popped up again my senior year. I had my sights set on winning a National Title before I left Iowa but I had two defending NCAA Champs in my weight class. I wrestled one of them, Mark Branch, in January and **lost by Major Decision because of my inability to get away from him.** The last month of the season Jimmy Zalesky taught me some rock-solid strategies for staying out of and clearing legs and Coach Gable put everyone we had in the room that ever threw a leg on top of me. He would have them shark me and at first it WAS NOT FUN.

**The bottom position can be a thorn in the side of many wrestlers and coaches.** This is typically most obvious when a wrestler moves up a level. It is almost expected for middle school wrestlers going to high school and high school wrestlers moving to the college ranks to all struggle in the bottom position. An experienced coach sees this coming and will try to find ways to keep this from happening.
 
Several core principles stand out to me from the bottom position. If wrestlers can understand these wrestling moves and strategies from the bottom they will often overcome their bottom struggles quickly. Many times escaping from the bottom position is a matter of hustle and grit, but it is also like solving a puzzle. If a wrestler is moving frantically, they can often find themselves flat on their belly with arms tied up and fighting for their life. If they hustle with the proper fundamentals in mind their fight will be much more efficient and effective. This is easier said than done, but if this is to be accomplished then simplicity is a major factor.
 
The Stand Up is the most fundamental method of escaping your opponent. Every wrestler should understand how to execute a Stand Up. More importantly, they should understand the position they should be in once they get to their feet and how to Hip Heist or clear away from opponents. Most wrestlers struggle with the stand up because they are taught to explode off the whistle straight to their head up and all motion shooting to the ceiling. This is the way I was taught and the way I taught it for a long time.
 
If the top wrestler is bumping or chopping and knocking the bottom wrestler off balance the bottom wrestler may need to post his hands on the mat to keep his balance and keep his hips under him. Returning to hand control as fast as possible.
 
If the bottom wrestler is broken down one easy thing they can focus on is to dig their hands in the mat. This will keep their arms from getting tied up and allow them to start pushing back into their opponent, slide their hips under them and work other holds from the mat or get back to their feet.
A Sit Out may be a good option for this position. The bottom wrestler can almost always get to their rear into a Sit Out position and has many options from that position.
 
The card had eight matches. The main event featured the "First-Ever" Confrontation between Impact World Tag Team Champions The Lucha Bros (Fnix and Pentagn Jr.) against Rob Van Dam and Sabu. Both the Impact Knockouts Championship and Impact X Division Championship were defended on the card, as Knockouts Champion Taya Valkyrie defended against Rosemary, Jordynne Grace and Katie Forbes while Rich Swann and AAA's Flamita wrestled for Swann's Impact X Division Championship. The event's undercard saw a six-man Ultimate X match for an X Division Championship match, Tessa Blanchard and Joey Ryan wrestling in an intergender match, and various other matches.

The event featured professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. On February 22, 2019, Impact Wrestling announced the date for United We Stand. On the same day, three matches were announced for the event.[2]
 
Next up we were introduced to **Demarcus Kane** who essentially came out in with a suit jacket and pants over his gear. He offered his opponent **LSG** (accompanied by **Gabby Ortiz**) $1,000 to walk away from the fight. LSG accepted, but upon counting the money realized it was only a stack of singles. Now the really cool thing about this match was that throughout the match LSG threw the stacks of singles into the crowd. Needless, to say the crowd was into it! The match ended with Kane scoring the victory after evading an LSG flying knee off the apron and accidentally causing him to hit Gabby with the attack. I just remember fans jumping out of their seats and running over to the barrier to look over and see if she was okay.
 
After intermission we were lucky to see the Impact! tag Champions **LAX** vs. the CZW tag Champions **The Rep** in a quick but very entertaining match-up. LAX were very over with the crowd and kept everyone amused with their antics and in ring skills. This match was full of tandem offense as Ortiz and Santana (LAX) were able to hit an impressive leg drop, springboard moonsault combo simultaneously. (pic) After a lot of back and forth the Impact tag champs were able to get the W to the delight of the live audience.
 
I have to say that this was one of the most fun Indy shows I had been to in a long time. The constant change of pace from match to match made the show flow nicely. (and fun) Having a majority of the roster available for fan interaction throughout the event was a huge plus. Additionally, with the announcement of both icons Goldberg and Sting coming to Boardwalk Beatdown this summer, Stand Alone Wrestling stands to make a major impact on the wrestling scene in the coming months.
 
Only a few minutes in, and this looks like a really fun clash of styles. The champions have already had the chance to showcase their power and size advantage, but the challengers have had plenty of chances to use their speed and athleticism to their advantage.
 
Then, mere moments later, Oba is seated in a chair at ringside and he gets completely wiped out by Dijak, who was standing on the top rope and was thrown off by Briggs. These three are cooking with gas.
 
Like the opening match, this match was nonstop big spot after big spot, and like the opening match, it was a ton of fun. It had several moments that are going to be featured on highlight reels, video packages, and YouTube compilations for years to come. **4.25 Stars**

The inside stand up is one of the most basic and effective ways to begin learning how to get out from bottom in wrestling. There are multiple variations to the stand up but this basic approach will help you develop the feel of proper back pressure.
 
In fairness, he went on to say that he will only serve four years. But this brings up an oft-repeated concern that he will never leave office if re-elected. Much of this talk from the right is for one simple reason: to troll. In fact, the GOP has become essentially a trolling party, taking the opposite position on every major issue from the Democrats, saying the most cruel things to get attention, and abandoning real policy platforms to simply reaffirm Trump's need for victory (and ego maintenance).
 
Donald Trump will leave office if he is elected, and with his health and mental decline, I would be surprised if he serves out his full term. Despite his loud mouth, he is, after all, a human, and a quite weak one at that.
 
Donald Trump, the overfed, overwatched, overpraised, overmedicated former President, recently spoke at the NRA convention and made a comment about potentially serving a third term. \\\"You know, FDR\u201416 years, almost 16 years. He was four-term. I don\u2019t know, are we going to be considered three term or two term?\u201D he asked the crowd during the event on Saturday. \\\"Are we three term or two term if we win?\\\" he added.
 
With the full understanding that these comments aim to inflame the anti-Trump coalition and stir the animal instincts of the right, how best should we respond? In a time where the political tone is set by food fights in Congress and attacks on \u201Cfake eyelashes,\u201D should we stand tall and rise above, or wrestle in the mud?
 
I\u2019m going to make the case that actually, it\u2019s both. On the one hand, it\u2019s important for this \u201Cuneasy coalition of the sane\u201D to model what true and righteous politics looks like. Serious debates over serious issues, mature and reasoned arguments placed in the public sphere for discussion and resolution, are something America sorely needs. Our younger generations have never seen politics this way, and I worry that it\u2019s an art form as ancient as the Age of Enlightenment. Sanity will not win by mimicking insanity.
