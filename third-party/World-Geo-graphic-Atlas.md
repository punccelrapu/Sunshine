Editorial note (EK). This text is a summary of exchanges between Marie Neurath, colleagues, and others relating to the World geo-graphic atlas, edited and designed by Herbert Bayer and privately published by Container Corporation of America in 1953. The exchanges provide testimony of concerns raised by Marie Neurath about pictorial statistics and other illustrative material that appeared in the atlas.

The summary principally draws on documents held in the Otto and Marie Neurath Isotype Collection, University of Reading. For a fuller discussion of this matter and issues of attribution, copyright, and the influence of Isotype on the World geo-graphic atlas, see Benjamin Benus, Herbert Bayer's World geo-graphic atlas and information design at mid-century, Rochester (NY): RIT Press, 2023, especially pp. 77&dash;91.

 
This text was drafted in December 2012 and January 2013, with minor revisions made in February 2017. Compilation of the text benefitted from additional notes and documentation supplied by Robin Kinross and Christopher Burke. Several items marked for checking in the draft have been amended or deleted in light of their clarification in Benus (2023).



In June 1954, Marie Neurath first became aware of the World geo-graphic atlas, privately published by Container Corporation of America (CCA). The atlas had appeared the previous year, edited and designed by Herbert Bayer, an Austrian migr designer who had arrived in the USA in 1938 and in 1946 became a consultant to CCA. [1] In a letter to Waldemar Kaempffert, a longstanding friend and supporter, Marie Neurath wrote:
 
By chance I noticed on the desk of someone in this building a big and lavishly produced book, of the size and weight of our Gesellschaft und Wirtschaft. It is called World geo-graphic atlas .... In the preface credit is given to many persons, institutions, books etc. but not to us. When you open the book you will notice that this could not have [been] produced without a very detailed knowledge of our work. [2]
 
Although referring in general to the pictorial statistics, pictograms, and other graphics that appear throughout the atlas, Marie Neurath also identified two instances where she felt that borrowings had occurred: on p. 182, where a chart from Modern man in the making had been adapted (and noted there as 'modified from Otto Neurath "Modern Man in the Making" A. A. Knopf'); and on p. 200, where a cutaway illustration of a windmill had been adapted from an illustration in Marie Neurath's book, If you could see inside (1948, p. 23). [3] 'I think it is not according to the rules of common politeness', she continued, 'to do such a thing without even trying to get our agreement.'
 
In her letter to Kaempffert, Marie Neurath asked for his advice about what might be done. Several options were mentioned: that she write directly to CCA for an explanation; that Alfred A. Knopf, publisher of Modern man in the making, be asked if they had given their agreement and if not, whether Knopf might write to CCA; or that the atlas be reviewed in The New York Times (where Kaempffert was science editor), where it might be stated that the atlas's 'rather unique methods of presentation' be identified as derived from Isotype, to whom credit should be given. [4] Her remarks end on a conciliatory note: because the atlas was privately published, there was no case for legal action in her view ('which I should hate of course'); and she could also see the value of the atlas, remarking 'for our work for Vienna on world social and economic developments this is quite a good source I think, anyway we shall try to learn something from it, too.' [5]
 
Immediately after receiving the letter from Marie Neurath, Kaempffert wrote to Knopf putting her concerns to the publisher; he received a reply from Alfred Knopf himself a few days later. [6] From Knopf's reply, it appears that Kaempffert characterized the matter as copyright infringement, something Marie Neurath did not mention originally.
 
I have your letter of June 22nd. I think it probably best for me to forward a copy of this to my friend Walter P. Paepcke, since I, as a great admirer of his Atlas, am a prejudiced party and can hardly believe my eyes when I read your description of it as consisting of 'charts based upon Otto Neurath's Gessellschaft und Wirtschaft &lsqb;sic&rsqb; published in Liepzig in 1930.' That to me is like saying that The New York Times on Sunday consists [only] of Section IV.
 
I doubt if any representation was asked us in connection with the chart on page 182, as we would never authorize credit to be given to A. A. Knopf, which I regard as something that doesn't exist. However, in any case, it seems to me that there isn't the slightest evidence of a genuine copyright infringement and that Mrs. Neurath has lost her sense of proportion in asking you to write me. [7]
 
Your letter of June 28 puzzles me. Marie Neurath is a very intelligent woman who collaborated with her husband, Otto, for years. Surely she ought to know the origin of Paepcke's charts and all the more since Otto Neurath's Isotype method has been in worldwide use ever since it was introduced. Very few of those who appropriated it gave him credit. The result is that very few people know who invented it. This is sad, but something that probably could not be avoided.
 
I don't see that there is much use in pursuing this matter further. You own the copyright of 'Man in the Making,' &lsqb;sic&rsqb; and if in your opinion Paepcke has not infringed it there is nothing more to be done. [8]
 
I think you and Mrs. Neurath are quite justified in resenting the fact that the Neuraths have not, generally speaking, been given credit for their work. But in this case I think your inquiry ought to be addressed to Herbert Bayer, in Aspen, who is responsible for the Atlas.
 
Kaempffert forwarded the exchange of letters to Marie Neurath in London in early July, and in a brief note stated: 'As you will see from the enclosed letter Knopf sees no infringement of his copyright in the case that you asked me to call to his attention. I don't suppose that anything more can be done. Knopf is the only person who can take any legal action.' Ten days later he wrote to again express his doubts that protesting would do any good, given Knopf's indifference and his friendship with Paepcke. [10]
 
By this time, Marie Neurath had left London on the first of her working visits to the Western Region of Nigeria where she would remain until the following September. While in Nigeria, Marie Neurath also corresponded about the matter with her friend Philipp Rieger. She had already instructed him to write a letter to CCA asking for an explanation, which he did. [11] A reply was received from CCA that seems to have acknowledged that more credit might be due Otto Neurath than was stated in the atlas. Marie Neurath replied in turn, setting out her complaints; these again focused on the lack of credit given to Isotype, CCA's problematic copyright notice on numerous pages in the atlas that contained pictorial statistics, and the lack of credit for the windmill drawing; she concluded by asking that some redress be suggested by CCA. [12]
 
A review of the World geo-graphic atlas leaves little doubt that in its pictorial statistics, pictograms, and in some graphics, Bayer's work owed a debt to Isotype in general, and in particular to Modern man in the making and probably one or several other Isotype publications. [13] Apart from the two specific graphics Marie Neurath identified as borrowed, the style of Bayer's pictograms derives from Isotype originals: in design they are similar and in places their content is nearly or wholly identical (mining, petroleum, steel, cotton, corn, grain, and so on). [14] It is equally clear that Bayer lacked a full understanding of Isotype methods. This is apparent, for example, in the inconsistent use of colour categories for pictograms [15], in the redundant labelling of pictograms with identifying words, and in one use of a modified Mercator projection (i.e., not equal area, as preferred by Isotype) in combination with pictorial statistics. Overall, Bayer's pictorial statistics suffer from that which Otto Neurath had warned against: boring rows of numbers becoming boring rows of pictograms. [16]
 
In pointing to only two specific instances where borrowing was thought to have occurred, but which others questioned, Marie Neurath perhaps indirectly demonstrated the even greater difficulty in establishing any precise attribution of credit in regard to Isotype method and graphic style in general. Versions of pictorial statistics like Bayer's would always be more or less legitimate as interpretations, even if - like so many others - his too lacked the rigour, coherence, variety, and refinement of Isotype and did not [with one exception] carry any acknowledgment of source or inspiration.


 
In 1954 I had a correspondence with your Mr. Wagonseller in connection with your World geographic atlas. In his letter of July 26, 1954 ... Mr. Wagonseller wrote: 'We appreciate having the benefit of your comments and if future editions of our Atlas are printed, we will give careful thought to the matter of giving general credit to outstanding contributors in this field, including your late husband.'
 
After this correspondence, an atlas has appeared in Germany: Goldmanns Grosser Weltatlas. In it a wide use has been made of the 'Herbert Bayer pages', and again the credit for the 'creation' of symbols and method has been given to Herbert Bayer in the general introduction. [18]
 
Nevertheless, I have not asked for more than a fair acknowledgment of the indebtedness to our work of which you are obviously aware. To give the credit which is due to my husband's work would remove all ill
