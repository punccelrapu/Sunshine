**Undergraduate School:** If you plan on a degree in biostatistics, do you need to major in biostatistics as an undergraduate? Not at all. In fact, most of us did not. You do not even have to be an undergraduate math major, although most graduate schools will require a strong math background. So plan on three semesters of calculus, a semester of linear algebra, and introductory probability and/or statistics as a minimum, with real analysis and advanced calculus required for some programs.

What other types of courses should you take as an undergraduate? Many graduate programs in biostatistics recommend biology, epidemiology, ecology, or other science courses. I personally wish I had taken college chemistry; it would have helped me in every job I have held since graduate school. If you have not yet done so, it would be useful to learn a programming language or statistical package. I had one colleague who swore a course in logic was an invaluable aid to him, but I imagine few statisticians have taken logic in college.
 
If your aim is to develop new theoretical statistical methods, then you would be well served obtaining a theory-based doctorate from a theoretically inclined statistics or biostatistics department. If your aim is to teach in a biostatistics department, then again, you will need a doctoral degree.
 
A simple algorithm regarding degrees is that the more demanding the degree, the greater the range of opportunities and, in general, the higher the salary that you can command. View this Amstat News article for an idea of the 2009 salaries broken down by degree, years of experience, and type of job.
 
**Jobs:** What do you want to do? Chances are you do not know what career is best, and even if you think you know, your plans may change with time and circumstances. I graduated with my PhD thinking I would teach biostatistics forever. That never happened. I ended up teaching elementary math and statistics in a mathematics department for three years before moving into industry (Ralston Purina), medical devices (Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corporation), the pharmaceutical industry (Astra), and consulting to the pharmaceutical industry (Rho, Inc.) While this career path was not my plan, it has worked well for me. Because a biostatistician is so employable, I was able to move where my husband moved and maintain my career in biostatistics.

Since the publication of this article, I have received many questions that can be better answered by those who are up-to-date on the specific programs. If you are interested in graduate school then I suggest this:
 
Thanks so much for the article. I need your advice as far as my academic path. I have a bachelor degree in Economics and I am interested in Biostatistcs program. I just started to take some classes in UCF, major statistics and I am done with all Calc/Chem/Bio classes. Do you think its better to go ahead and apply for biostatistcs program in USF or should I continue till I finish my bachelor in statistcs.
 
Hi Javier,
I am also like you finishing my PhD in molecular biology and thinking of doing a Masters in Biostatistics and wondering the same thing whether my PhD degree will be of any value down road. Will you please let me know whether you have got good information regarding that and what have you done for your case.
Thank you
 
Awesome article!! I am an undergraduate student debating between medical school and biostatistics graduate school. I was wondering how possible it is for biostatisticians in the medical or pharmaceutical industry to be promoted to an executive position? My dream is to serve on the management board of a biotech company one day.
 
Hi,
I am from India working as a lecturer in a university (in Statistics). I have been offered a fully funded PhD in biostatistics (designing clinical trials) at a US university. Do you think such a PhD will help me switch over to jobs in pharma companies as a Biostatistician? And what is the scope as a lecturer specialising in biostatistics?
 
Hi Michelle,
I know many masters degree holders who have jobs in biostatistics. I have heard that it has gotten tougher to find jobs, however. I would contact chairs or directors of admissions of different degree programs and ask what is happening in the market now.
 
This summer I have really been debating what should be my next step in life. The problem is that I have always wanted to get my PhD, do research, and makes lots of money. I just received my Masters in Biostatistics this past Spring.I was accepted (full funding and stipend) into a top ranked school in Biostatistics. However, I thought it would be interesting to test my luck in getting a job. Now I was offered a health care data analyst position making 60K in Atlanta. Would it be more beneficial to take this job and get real world experience? Or should I just take 4 more years and finish my PhD. By the way, my goal in life is not to teach. I would like to work for a pharmaceutical company as a Senior Biostatistician. Is it possible to have such a position without a PhD? Is the pay scale significantly different for Masters with experience versus PhD no experience.
 
Yes, you can be a Senior Biostatistician w/ a masters but you are likely to achieve that goal sooner with a PhD. Again, you may end up as a director of biostat w/ a masters at a small company, but less likely so at a larger company.
 
Hi,
Yes, you can do a PhD in biostats with a bachelors in pharmacy. You would have to check with each program of interest to determine whether your math background is sufficient, or if you would need to take some additional coursework prior to starting the degree program.
 
I am not in a position to evaluate US programs. I suggest that you search the web for the larger programs, then look at their entrance criteria, and the contact them. Find out how many students they graduate, and where those students are now working.
 
If you join the ASA section on Statistical Consulting, you will from time to time receive emails in a chat-room sort of way. Sometimes the emails address issues relating to running a consulting business; other times they are specific technical issues. In any event, it might be useful to join. Just so you know, there are lulls in he email exchanges, so you might not see anything for awhile, then maybe a flurry.
 
(1)Due to the fact that I had to work to carter for bills,I decided to go part time.I have one more course to take in Spring of 2013 amd I am done with my masters program. I really want to go in for my PhD in Fall 2013. Will you advise me to go ahead and apply for a PhD program in Fall 2013 eventhough I have one more course to take in Spring 2013? If not,then I just have to wait till Fall 2014 which is such a long time.Please advise.
 
Thanks for this very informative article. I have a Ph.D. in psychology with a background in evaluating the effectiveness/efficacy of psychological interventions (therapy, etc.). I have been working in research/academia, but I am considering a move to the private sector and I am sussing out my options. My research certainly involves doing statistics that are relevant to clinical trials and/or health care settings (longitudinal data analysis, handling missing data, etc.) and I have excellent communication skills. Do you think biostatistics is an option for me? Do I need further education before I will be of interest for biostatistics jobs, or is a psychology Ph.D. potentially good enough as long as I have the needed skillsets (proficiency in SAS programming and so on)?
 
Good morning Katherine,
I have a Ph.D in Medicinal Chemistry, worked in the pharmaceutical industry designing drugs for 7 years and for the last 5 years have started my own firm based in the US with 15 employees overseas in India doing BIO\_IT. I am now interested in moving myself and my company in the area of Biostatistics (I have deep interest in math). What kind of degree program would you suggest ?
Thanks
Sam
 
Hi Sam,
I would suggest that you join the Statistical Consulting Section of the ASA and read the MS vs PhD tread that is going on. I think there is a way to get to previously-sent emails. If you have trouble, Rick Peterson at ASA might be able to help you.
 
thanks so much for this article in biostatistics.
I am a graduate in Micrebiology (BSC) and I will greatly love study Biostatistics at the masters level.
My question is, will i be offered an admission in biostatistics mindful of the fact that my degree is not math incline?
 
Hi Katherine,
Thank you for this article. It is really informative to choose a career in Biostatistic. Presently i am doing PhD in Biochemistry and Medical genetics in Canada. During my undergrad (Bachelor of Technology) in Biotechnology, i had done undergrad level of statistic. Last two term of my PhD, i had taken Biostatistic courses. One was basic biostatistic and another was based on SAS program. I am good in Math as well. I like to shift my career to Biopharma Company as a biostatiscian. Do I need further education before I will be of interest for biostatistics jobs. If yes, what are the steps can you suggest me.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
 
Hi Sania,
Some of those who earn a masters in biostats end up taking jobs as SAS programmers. However, there are many SAS programmers who know no statistics and
