All that said, martial arts are still excellent supplementary training to have under your belt (especially a black one). Each style I recommend below has a lot to offer, whether more traditional or more mixed martial arts. But if your goal is to learn how to defend yourself in real life situations, choose your martial arts style wisely, be aware of its shortcomings, and make sure you round out your training with other self defense skills.

The other thing I love about Krav Maga is its training environment. Krav Maga classes are often practiced in street clothes without gloves or padding. This is to help simulate what a real fight would feel like, so you can better prepare your body for those conditions. I use this same philosophy in my own Tough Cookie Self Defense Course. You want to practice your self defense skills in as realistic a setting as possible, with as much full force and adrenaline as you can, so your muscles can memorize performing these moves under the worst case scenarios.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art that has gained popularity in recent years, thanks to its success in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions. Controlling an opponent through grappling and submission holds is the goal of BJJ. One of the most common and efficient submissions in BJJ is the rear naked choke. This method entails applying pressure to the neck of the target opponent to impede blood flow between the heart and brain, rendering them unconscious.
 
As BJJ focuses more on leverage than strength, it is a great method of self-defense for persons of various sizes and types. Also, it's a great workout that increases strength and endurance while enhancing flexibility, balance, and coordination. Frequent BJJ training is a good kind of self-care because it helps to lower tension and anxiety. A Gi (uniform), BJJ rash guards, BJJ shorts, or spats are needed to practice BJJ. But it's also advised to wear a mouth guard and sports tape on your fingertips.
 
Krav Maga is a self-defense system developed in Israel that has gained popularity worldwide due to its practical and effective techniques. One of the most popular techniques in Krav Maga is its focus on neutralizing threats quickly and aggressively, using strikes, kicks, and joint locks to incapacitate attackers. Krav Maga practitioners also train in situational awareness and de-escalation strategies to avoid confrontations altogether.
 
When it comes to gear, Krav Maga practitioners typically wear comfortable, lightweight clothing that allows for ease of movement. Protective gear such as gloves, shin guards, and mouthguards may also be used during training to prevent injuries. However, Krav Maga emphasizes the use of improvised weapons such as everyday objects like keys, belts, or pens as an additional defense strategy.
 
In addition to its practical applications, Krav Maga offers a range of health benefits. It provides a full-body workout that improves strength, endurance, and flexibility, while also developing self-confidence and mental toughness. Krav Maga training can also help reduce stress and anxiety, as well as improve coordination and reaction time, making it a holistic practice that not only prepares individuals for dangerous situations but also enhances overall physical and mental wellbeing.
